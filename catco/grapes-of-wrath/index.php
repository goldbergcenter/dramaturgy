<h1><a name=Introduction></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>The historian Alan Brinkley (in a review of Steppenwolf's New
  York production) has written this about <em>The
  Grapes of Wrath</em>: "... Steinbeck's
  novel is more than an intriguing period piece. Despite its many flaws it speaks to modern audiences, as it did to
  audiences in the 1930's, by evoking one of America's most powerful and
  cherished images of itself. It suggests
  that running like a river beneath the surface of the nation's cold, hard,
  individualistic culture lies the spirit of Ma Joad, a spirit of 'fambly' and
  community that, once tapped, might redeem us all." ("Why Steinbeck's Okies Speak to Us Today," <em>New York Times</em>,
  18 March 1990, Arts &amp; Leisure section, p. 13). The novel that had challenged a nation's soul
  late in the Depression decade still resonates in American hearts and minds over
  a half century later. </p>
<p>CATCO put together the following overviews, analyses, and
  references to help the actors, technicians, and audience more fully appreciate
  CATCO's production of Frank Galati's adaptation of John Steinbeck's <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. We look first at the nature of American
  culture in the 1930s and how John Steinbeck and the documentary tradition
  interacted with that culture. Then we
  present a brief biography of John Steinbeck, a discussion of the novel's
  history and structure, and analyses of the novel's relation to history,
  particularly the Dust Bowl, migrant patterns, and migrant life. A brief section on the film follows. A longer section on Steppenwolf's adaptation
  includes discussion of Frank Galati, the production's development, a brief
  synopsis of the adaptation, critics' views, and a list of other productions by
  Galati. There will follow a section on
  how CATCO decided to approach the production. Finally, sections on what happened to the Okies and migrants in Ohio in the 1930s precede the final section, a list of
  references and suggestions for further research. All of this information is intended to
  present a glimpse into the creative process and to enrich the audience members'
  experience of one of America's most significant play adaptations.</p>

<h1><a name="America_in_the_1930s"></a>America in the 1930s</h1>
<p>In
  hindsight, the strong and sharply divided reaction to the publication of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in 1939, and to the
  film adaptation in 1940, is not surprising. Steinbeck's artistic achievement tapped into and embodied some
  significant cultural transformations that had been occurring in the United
  States for over a generation. The novel
  also joined a plethora of criticisms of the changing political economy. And it challenged some American beliefs and
  new cultural trends as well as reaffirmed long-held American values.</p>
<p><strong>The Political-Economic Context</strong> </p>
<p>Historians who study the Great Depression, alas, do not agree
  on what caused the horrendous economic downturn, which affected most of the
  world. Some emphasize monetary policy
  (the increase or decrease in the money supply); others suggest that a major
  change in the structure of the economy brought on the downturn (similar to
  recent debates about "old" and "new" economies). Generally speaking, however, we can point to
  some significant facts and trends. By
  the late 1920s, Americans were producing more industrial and agricultural goods
  than they were consuming. By 1933, one
  out of four Americans who wanted to work could not find jobs; "service"
  enterprises like fast foods, laundries, and motels did not constitute a
  significant portion of the economy to which the unemployed could retreat. Throughout America, "Hoovervilles"
  sprung up in urban and rural areas. Named after President Herbert Hoover, who many blamed for the downturn,
  these shanty towns constructed of playboard and
  cardboard housed many of the unemployed. Many of these turned their pants pockets inside-out, which were in turn
  called "Hoover flags." </p>
<p>While there was lots of political conflict across the land, and
  some localized violence here-and-there (labor-management conflicts, farmers
  fighting sheriffs who were selling neighbors' farms, California farmers
  mistreating migrants), the fact remains that Americans' responses to the Great
  Depression did not include widespread violence and attempts to overthrow the
  government. Instead, Americans hotly
  debated the issues and competed in the political arena to have the right to
  determine appropriate responses. For
  example, thousands of unemployed veterans congregated in Washington, D.C., in
  the spring of 1932 to demand that the government give them the bonus Congress
  had authorized for them to receive in their old age (in the 1940s). President Hoover ordered the protesters
  removed in a peaceful manner, but unfortunately, the officer in charge, Douglas
  MacArthur, exceeded his orders and many of the Bonus Army were injured. President Franklin D.
  Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, did not agree with the veterans
  either, but he treated them more humanely than had his predecessor's
  administration. Beginning in March 1933,
  and employing many of Hoover's ideas, Roosevelt and the Democratic Party worked
  hard to stem the economic downturn. Their efforts over the next six or so years boosted the American spirit
  and strengthened the Democratic Party, but their so-called "New Deal" never did
  bring about economic recovery; only mobilization for World War II brought back
  full employment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must remember that if one-in-four were jobless,
  three-in-four had jobs (by the late 1930s, unemployment remained at a high 17
  percent). Many workers took pay cuts
  (President Roosevelt ordered a 10 percent pay cut for Federal workers shortly
  after taking office in March 1933), and many others were underemployed, but
  they held jobs. While the Joad family lumbered across the desert in search of work,
  others motored across that same desert to enjoy family vacations in California
  and other areas of the American Southwest. (My maternal grandfather, for example, was a
  government employee at the San Diego Navy Yard and he began a rather expensive
  hobby around 1936--home movie production). For the majority of Americans, the Great
  Depression was an inconvenience that occasioned lots of fear--would they be
  next to lose their jobs? would the government be up to
  the task of preventing revolution?--but it was not the experience for them that
  it was for those like the Joads, who we shall learn
  below, represented a very small percentage of the American population.</p>
<p>The plight of the unemployed not only attracted the attention
  of the New Dealers, but it also joined with other cultural transformations to
  focus the majority of Americans' attention on something they had not seen much
  of before: the marginal or common man in
  society. This discovery had profound
  implications for the culture and the politics of the American nation and set
  the stage for stormy reactions to the publication of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Transformations</strong> </p>
<p>Americans had discovered "culture" in the 1920s, and by the
  Depression decade, the attempt to define "the American way of life" in cultural
  terms was well underway. Several forces
  introduced Americans to the concept of culture. America's growing prominence in the world arena, the emergence of the
  social sciences, particularly anthropology, the spread of new media
  (photographs, film, radio, mass circulation magazines like <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em>), and the
  resurgence of an old medium (books! for Americans began to read more
  non-fiction than fiction in the 1930s) prompted Americans to look at themselves
  in ways that they had never done before. Two anthropological works, Stuart Chase's <em>Mexico: A Study of Two Americas</em> (1931) and Ruth Benedict's <em>Patterns of Culture</em> (1934) strongly influenced American views
  towards culture. So too did historical
  romance novels, with Margaret Mitchell's <em>Gone
  With the Wind</em> (1936) leading the way, introduce Americans to other ways of
  life (in Mitchell's case, the American South, which even today remains somewhat
  mysterious to many Americans). In the
  words of American cultural historian Warren I. Susman,</p>
<p> Americans began ... thinking in terms of patterns of
  behavior and belief, values and life-styles, symbols and meanings. It was during this period that we find, for
  the first time, frequent reference to an 'American Way of Life.' The phrase 'The American Dream' came into
  common use; it meant something shared collectively by all Americans; yet
  something different than the vision of an American Mission, the function of the
  organized nation itself. (<em>Culture as
  History</em>, 154)</p>
<p>In one sense, Americans were trying
  to define their civilization in relation to the other great civilizations of
  history.  And, rather than reject the "marginal man" in their midst,
  Americans began to incorporate him--and her--into their cultural
  definition of "American."</p>
<p>Steinbeck's <em>The Grapes of
  Wrath</em> tapped both an old and new sense of being American. As Susman has
  argued, "it is a novel of the enforced wanderings of marginal men with a
  difference, in fact with several crucial differences. Marginal man here was not alone; the strength
  and power of the family as a unit went with him. ... he shared with
  other travelers ... common purpose ... destiny." (170-171) Indeed, while American artists in the
  1920s and 1930s (John Dos Passos, Steinbeck,
  photographers) focused on the "marginal" or "common man," they did so for an
  audience that represented the majority of Americans--the middle class. And Americans embraced the "folk" American in
  mythic terms, identified with the "folk" as part of the American
  tradition. This sense of many different
  kinds of Americans belonging together was very strong by the 1930s.</p>
<p>The diversity theme emerging in the 1930s was found also in the
  nation's music. "Folk" music became
  especially important, but other musical styles co-evolved with folk music,
  including country swing, jazz (which some see as <em>the</em> indigenous music of the U.S.), big band, and blues. For the migrants in California who played
  music, "The minstrel stage, tin pan alley, early country, and cowboy music were
  all popular music sources that fed the performers' repertoires." [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/afctshtml/tsme.html]
  The migrants liked especially the Carter Family, Jimmy Rodgers, and Gene
  Autry. The migrants'
  music--that which they listened to and that which they created--included themes
  of hardship and disappointment and the desire to return home.</p>
<p><strong>New Deal and the Common Man</strong> </p>
<p>Political change underscored the cultural change. The Franklin Roosevelt-led New Deal
  Democrats, which took over the reins of government from the Republicans, who
  had maintained for a generation control of the government, utilized the mass
  media to promote their politics and American values, including belief in the
  "common man" and the power of technology to solve any social problems. For example, they hired the balladeer Woodie Guthrie to write songs that reflected the "common
  man" in America and how the common man contributed to the strength of the
  nation. Later in the decade, government
  agents fanned out across the land to record the folk music of America. And they influenced Hollywood and even hired
  filmmakers to produce films touting the American way of life.</p>
<p>New Deal Democrats also constructed institutions intended to
  structurally change the political economy in order to combat the Depression and
  prevent another one from occurring. <em>The New Deal did not bring the economy out
  of the Depression; only mobilization for World War II did that.</em> Nonetheless, the New Deal Democrats were
  successful in three areas. First, the
  various relief programs lifted the spirits of the American people simply by
  showing them that someone cared. Second,
  they reformed the political economy so that another great depression would not
  occur. They established a plethora of
  "alphabet agencies" to regulate particular sectors of the economy (banking,
  stock market, transportation, agriculture, etc.). </p>
<p>Third, the New Dealers mixed their economic programs with
  cultural ones that focused on the "common man." For example, the Works Progress Administration (1935ff) included not
  only relief and work-relief programs for the unemployed laborer, but also
  cultural programs (a theatre project, Post Office murals, jobs for writers,
  etc.) for unemployed artists. The New
  Deal included the Resettlement Administration (RA, 1935-1937) and then the Farm
  Security Administration (FSA, 1937ff) to help displaced farmers deal with the
  economic changes that so concerned Steinbeck. But the RA and FSA ran into cultural traditions (which Steinbeck alludes
  to) that made it difficult for the reformers to convince those being reformed
  to follow the new cultural values. Coupled with the political thrust of New Deal initiatives, these
  institutions underscored the American quest for cultural definition and led to
  Americans discovering that their culture, their civilization, was very
  different from others.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Americans discovered the heritage not only of the
  various ethnicities of the European immigrants who had helped America
  industrialize, but also of Native Americans and, more slowly, (prompted in part
  by the New Deal-inspired WPA State Guidebooks) that of African Americans (who
  became by 1936 an important part of the New Deal Democrat coalition). Marginal or minority groups now mattered
  (Hispanics and Asians were still excluded), not only at the ballot box (which
  the Democrats exploited well), but also in the culture at large; strength
  through diversity, reflected in the Democratic Party's majority, was becoming a
  recognized American cultural trait. If
  the New Deal programs did not bring about economic recovery, they did help
  Americans see themselves as made up of diverse peoples.</p>
<p><strong>Critics of the New Deal</strong></p>
<p>Not all Americans supported the New Deal programs.</p>
<p>For some, the Democrats were doing too much to alter the
  economy and help the common man. In
  1934, with executives of key corporations in the lead, the Liberty League began
  a campaign that painted the New Deal as worse than fascism or communism. For the most part, the Liberty League did not
  matter all that much until later in the decade, when more conservatives
  (Democrats from the South and Republicans) began to fight the perceived
  nationalization of politics that they alleged the New Dealers had created. (Actually, most of the major New Deal laws
  and agencies included a role for the states; Roosevelt, for the most part--the
  Court Packing scheme was an exception--promoted "federalism," not
  nationalization.)</p>
<p>Most critics of Roosevelt and the New Deal, however, argued
  that the New Deal was not doing enough to help the common man deal with the
  economic depression. These critics
  mattered much more than the Liberty League, and they
  pressed President Roosevelt to expand the Federal government more than he
  wanted to. These "critics on the left"
  included Senator Huey Long (D-La) and Father Charles E. Coughlin, and, in
  Steinbeck's California, Francis E. Townsend and Upton Sinclair. Huey Long (who President Roosevelt once labeled
  one of the two most dangerous men in America), promoted his own political
  fortunes through the "Share Our Wealth" program. Long, who as governor of Louisiana in the
  1920s had elevated that state's infrastructure (schools, highways) to aid all
  citizens of the state, argued that the government should make sure that every
  American had a middle class life. To do
  this, he advocated liquidating all personal fortunes over $3 million dollars
  and distributing that money to all Americans. Father Charles E. Coughlin, the "radio priest" from Michigan, exhorted
  millions of Americans to demand social justice for all and less power for the
  private sector banks and corporations. While initially drawing from the Catholic Church's long tradition of
  promoting social justice, Coughlin eventually turned to anti-Semitism to
  promote his political agendas. Finally,
  in 1942, the Church ordered him to cease his political activities, and he
  did. Significantly, both Long and
  Coughlin tended to attract members of the middle class--those who had not
  succumbed to the ravages of the Depression but who feared that they might one
  day be out of a job. (These were
  Steinbeck's audience as well.)</p>
<p>California in the 1930s seemed especially affected by political
  movements. Francis Townsend was
  different from Long and Coughlin in that he concentrated on one interest
  group--the elderly--and proposed a plan to help them and the nation's
  economy. While overly expensive and
  perhaps too bureaucratically complex to administer, his plan (each person over
  65 was to be given $200 a month on two conditions--they quit their jobs and
  spend every penny of the monthly stipend) held some merit with millions of
  Americans. A more modest New Deal
  program, the Social Security Act of 1935, rendered Townsend's political
  movement moot. Upton Sinclair, on the
  other hand, focused his energies on eliminating all poverty in the state. Persuaded to change his party affiliation
  from Socialist to Democrat, Sinclair ran for governor of California in
  1934. He established EPIC--End Poverty
  in California--as his basic platform. It
  directly challenged the capitalistic, private property basis of the state's
  economy: The state would take over idle
  factories and fields and allow the unemployed to produce their own food and goods
  for their own use. Sinclair and his
  followers, in effect, were saying that Roosevelt's New Deal had simply not gone
  far enough. Having won the Democratic
  primary handily, Sinclair faced in the general election a well-orchestrated
  campaign of distortions, lies, and dirty tricks, funded by California
  conservative business leaders and supported by Hollywood studios and
  actors. The old economic system endured
  in California.</p>
<p>In sum, then, <em>The Grapes
  of Wrath</em> appeared at a time in which Americans were receptive to stories of
  "other cultures" and particularly attracted to the "common man"; many were
  fearful that they, too, might succumb to the economic changes occurring; many
  were suspicious of the large-scale corporations that had funded the Liberty League
  and the attack on Upton Sinclair; and, a majority of Americans voting in the
  1934 and 1936 elections demanded that the Federal government do more than it
  had been for the down and out among them.</p>
<p>Steinbeck's novel also reflected another cultural movement in
  the U.S. that did much to focus Americans on the common man.</p>

<h1><a name="The_Documentary_Movement_in_the_1930s"></a>The Documentary Movement in the 1930s</h1>
<p>Steinbeck had intended the novel to "document" the plight of
  American migrants. He saw himself--and
  in fact he was--part of the documentary movement of the 1930s. The documentary approach began in the
  mid-to-late nineteenth century in England; in the U.S., it was Jacob Riis, with
  his publication of <em>How the Other Half
  Lives</em> (1903) who publicized the style in America. The muckrakers, such as Upton Sinclair, who
  published <em>The Jungle</em> in 1906, are
  also ancestors of the 1930s documentary style. In one ironic sense, <em>The Grapes of
  Wrath</em> grew out of Steinbeck's failure to follow this tradition: He had intended to publish a story with
  photos of migrant life in California for <em>Life</em> magazine; but, to him, the facts he uncovered and the events he had experienced
  could not be adequately conveyed in a text-photo journalism style; it required
  a long novel. But as many have noted,
  the novel included many elements of the documentary style.</p>
<p>What is the documentary style? Many in the 1930s saw the documentary as "propaganda," which in a sense
  it was, for it advocated a particular view of a particular situation. But the movement was more complicated than
  that; it included a sense that "art" was a legitimate vehicle for exposing the
  problems of the times. As William Stott
  points out in his book, <em>Documentary
  Expression in Thirties America</em>, "documentary," "[L]ike 'document,' from which it derives, ... has <em>two</em> meanings, ... These meanings are not
  mutually exclusive ... The first ... has been defined as 'presenting facts
  objectively and without editorializing and inserting fictional matter, ....'"
  (5-6) A second
  kind of document, the "human document," is not objective but personal. "... a human
  document carries and communicates feeling, the raw material of drama. Such a document gives some information that
  would be found in an impersonal document." (7) "We understand a historical document intellectually, but we understand a
  human document emotionally. In the
  second kind of document, as in documentary and the thirties' documentary
  movement as a whole, feeling comes first." (8)</p>
<p>Stott points out that Warren Susman "affirmed that 'the whole idea of documentary--not with words alone but with
  sight and sound--makes it possible to see, know, and feel the details of life,
  to feel oneself part of some other's experience.' [Susman implied
  that] one knows another's life because one feels it; one is informed--one sees
  it--through one's feelings. The
  practitioners of the documentary genre in the thirties realized, if dimly, the
  same thing: emotion counted more than
  fact." (8-9) Clearly,
  with his focus on the Joad family, Steinbeck employs
  "a human document"; but, in the intercalary chapters, Steinbeck also employed
  facts about the economy and the migrants that he had gathered during the
  decade.</p>
<p>Pare Lorentz, who was a friend of Steinbeck's, and who hired
  Steinbeck to work on some of his films, reigns as the most important
  documentary filmmaker of the period. Yet, some do not agree with that assessment; instead, they argue that
  Lorentz was a propagandist because he worked for the New Deal administration. His most famous productions (<em>The River</em> and <em>The Plow That Broke the Plains</em>, both produced in 1936 under the
  auspices of the RA) included both facts and emotions; but they also
  included--against Lorentz' request--sections that praised the New Deal programs
  designed to attack the consequences of the Depression.</p>
<p>Another form of documentary prominent in the 1930s, which drew
  from the legacy of Jacob Riis, was the photograph-text book. Many photographers, many employed by New Dea agencies, made their artistic reputations chronicling
  the common man in America. They included
  women (Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White) and men (James Agee and Walker
  Evans, of <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>,
  1941).</p>
<p>John Steinbeck was <em>of</em> these cultural forces, if not always <em>in</em> them.</p>

<p><img class="portrait" src="images/john-steinbeck.jpg" width="111" height="141" alt="John Steinbeck">
  Born in 1902, John Steinbeck remained in the Salinas Valley area of California
  until he went to Stanford in 1919, where he took writing courses. Exhibiting a tendency to fall behind in his
  studies, Steinbeck did not graduate. The
  Monterey peninsula was his favorite community, and from his experiences there,
  he wrote much of his best work. He left
  California for the first time at age 25, when he went to New York City as a
  journalist and sometime laborer. He
  returned to California, working for awhile as a caretaker of a Lake Tahoe
  estate, and in 1929, published his first novel, <em>Cup of Gold</em>. Two novels and
  short story writing barely sustained him until his first major success in 1935,
  the publication of <em>Tortilla Flat</em>. During the late 1930s, Steinbeck focused on
  California's white laboring class, publishing <em>In Dubious Battle</em> (1936), <em>Of
  Mice and Men</em> (1937), and <em>The Grapes
  of Wrath</em> (1939), which won in 1940 both a Pulitzer Prize and the Award of
  the American Booksellers Association, which is now called the National Book
  Award. He entered the filmmaking
  business (<em>The Forgotten Village</em>,
  1941) and supported the war effort as a journalist and author (<em>Bombs Away</em>, 1942). </p>
<p>Although his literary reputation waned somewhat after 1939,
  Steinbeck continued to publish regularly, even as he traveled widely around the
  world (he returned to California only occasionally in the 1940s): <em>Cannery
  Row</em> (1945), <em>The Wayward Bus</em> (1947), <em>The Pearl</em> (1947), <em>A Russian Journal</em> (1948), <em>Burning Bright</em> (1950), <em>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</em> (1951),
  and <em>East of Eden</em> (1952). In the 1950s, New York and Sag Harbor became
  the home of Steinbeck and his third wife, Elaine, a native of Texas, until his
  death in 1968. His <em>Travels with Charley in Search of America</em> (1962) revealed a man
  somewhat unsettled with the changes occurring in America, particularly the loss
  of community that he had grown up with in Monterey. In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize. He died in 1968, within a year of returning from
  a trip to Vietnam (which President Lyndon B. Johnson had asked him to make).</p>
<p>John Steinbeck had many friends, some of them rather prominent
  in artistic circles. Indeed, his friends
  and the strain of buying a new ranch house interfered with his writing <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> between June and October
  1938. Visitors included Lorentz and
  Charles Chaplin. His first wife, Carol,
  was his sounding board; he trusted her judgment implicitly and completely. He also had a good relationship with his
  editor and publisher (helping the latter out of bankruptcy when he agreed to go
  to Viking Press, but only if his old publisher was given a job).</p>
<p>Two important individuals who influenced Steinbeck in the 1930s
  were Pare Lorentz, noted above, and Tom Collins, manager of a government
  migrant camp. It was from Collins that
  Steinbeck received--even while he was writing the novel--important gritty
  details of the migrant camp experience.</p>

<p>Steinbeck <em>believed</em> in
  the migrants. He saw them as the future
  of California: "The Californian doesn't
  know what he does want. The Oklahoman
  knows just exactly what he wants. He
  wants a piece of land. And he goes after
  it and gets it." And, "Their coming here
  now is going to change things almost as much as did the coming of the first American
  settlers." [quoted in DeMott, <em>Working Days</em>, from Louis Walther,
  "Oklahomans Steinbeck's Theme," <em>San Jose
  Mercury Herald</em>, 8 January 1938] While he was embarrassed by the treatment they received and worried that
  the failure to change the circumstances would undermine California's economy,
  he also saw in the migrants themselves a resoluteness that would eventually
  save California.</p>
<p>Steinbeck consistently refused to go beyond the book to promote
  actively the migrants' cause. He was not
  "political" in the sense that he leant his name to various causes or even led
  rallies (one exception was the "Steinbeck Committee," which supported strikers,
  but Steinbeck himself did not actively promote this organization). Steinbeck did offer a solution to the migrant
  problem in California: The state should
  establish a Migrant Labor Board, which would regulate the number of migrants,
  oversee the camps, and during the off-season provide the migrants some land on
  which they could grow their own vegetables. Hardly a radical plan, it reflected Steinbeck's basic conservatism: He believed in the migrants, but he also
  believed in "America." He understood
  that the economic changes occurring meant that the large-scale corporations
  were not going to go away and that ways must be found to make the corporation
  act more morally. The novel implies that
  the strength of family and communities coming together ("I to we") might work, but there is no real conviction behind it.</p>

<h1><a name="The_Novel"></a>The Novel</h1>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>The publication of <em>Grapes
  of Wrath</em> in 1939 created, as Steinbeck predicted, a firestorm of
  controversy. Several cities in the U.S.
  banned the book because the sexual content and "leftist" views offended some
  citizens. The novel sold more copies
  than any other contemporary work, except <em>Gone
  with the Wind</em> (it was a best seller in Oklahoma). Politicians in California and Oklahoma
  criticized Steinbeck's emotionalism, charged him with misrepresenting the
  facts, and accused him of supporting "anti-American" values. Others praised Steinbeck for being the
  conscience of America. Certainly, for
  its content and style and for the responses it elicited, <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> must be considered as one of the most important
  works in all of American literature.</p>
<p>Indeed, this novel represented Steinbeck's third attempt
  to write the story of the migrants in Depression America. <em>In
  Dubious Battle</em> (1936) dealt with striking California migrant farm workers,
  but it cynically concluded that communist leaders organized only to serve the
  party, not oppressed individuals, and that individuals were incapable of
  organizing collectively against oppression. The next effort Steinbeck burned: <em>L'Affaire</em><em> Lettuceberg</em>,
  in his own words, was a "mean, nasty book." But writing it allowed Steinbeck to get the hate out of his system so
  that he could produce the masterpiece.</p>
<p><em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> represented Steinbeck's final effort to explore the reasons behind and the
  possible responses to the failure of American society that the plight of the
  migrants reflected. That the migrants
  existed at all in a country based on the worship of and the achievements in
  material progress framed the story in terms of failure. There was a loss of spirit or hollowness in
  the plight of the Joads ('that's not supposed to
  happen in America'). Steinbeck wondered
  if the Joads--and the American people--could rise to
  the challenge.</p>
<p>The novel had an important impact on other social
  commentators. Dorothea Lange, infamous
  photographer for the Farm Security Administration, had traveled about the
  South, Southwest, and California documenting life of America's poor even before
  the novel was published. After
  Steinbeck's masterpiece came out, she went looking for migrants who reflected
  the Joads and she found them. Perhaps her most famous photo, "Migrant
  Mother," was in fact one of half a dozen photos she took of the same woman; the
  two of them experimented until they got the "look" that each wanted; emotion
  more than fact or reality ruled Lange's photography.</p>
<p><strong>Structure, Meanings, and Influences</strong></p>
<p>Good fiction fractures reality and puts it back together in
  such a way as to lead the reader to a comprehension of central truths and
  realities that were hidden from everyday life.</p>
<p>Three perspectives frame the novel: <strong>the
  economic</strong> (agriculture, technology, banks, management/labor); <strong>the social</strong> (how individuals behave
  alone and in groups; how they respond or not to change); and, <strong>the philosophical</strong> (and/or religious;
  how Steinbeck relates human experience to the larger natural view of the
  world). While through each of these
  perspectives universal truths and realities are revealed, the American
  setting of the novel reveals as well specific American truths and
  realities.</p>
<p>The novel is broken into three chronological narratives: </p>
<p>(1) Chapters 1 - 11 focus on the land, the
  drought and dust, and why the Joads left; </p>
<p>(2) Chapters 12 - 18 present the migration or
  exodus of the Joad family to the promised land of
  California; </p>
<p>(3) Chapters 19-30 present the sojourn in
  California, Jim Casy's death and Tom Joad's decision to carry on his fight, and Rose of Sharon's
  unselfish act.</p>
<p>Steinbeck interspersed intercalary (interconnecting) chapters
  (a technique he borrowed from John Dos Passos, who
  had great success with his <em>USA</em> trilogy in the 1920s and 1930s). These
  "generalist" chapters offered the reader the broader story within which the Joad family's saga took place.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Steinbeck's novel clearly
  reflects religious inspirations and other American cultural themes and
  myths. The Joads represent the chosen people, the Iraelites,
  Americans. The preacher, Jim Casy, just like Jesus Christ (both have the same initials),
  wanders for awhile, thinking, and rejects old religion for a new one;
  sacrifices himself for others unselfishly; tells his murderers they know not
  what they are doing; inspires others (Tom) to carry on the fight. Rose of Sharon's unselfish act at the end of
  the story represents the resurrection of Christ. The Bible contains numerous references to
  "grapes" and "wrath." In Numbers 13:23, grapes
  represent abundance; in Deuteronomy 32:32, grapes represent wrath and
  vengeance. And, of course, Julia Ward
  Howe's song, "Battle Hymn of the Republic," relates to Revelation 14:19--"the
  great winepress of the wrath of God." The phrase in the song, "Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent
  with his heel," clearly is reflected in the last scene of the novel, if one
  sees the serpent as big business agriculture/capitalism, which had manipulated
  the Joads, the starving man and boy, and all migrants. Fittingly, perhaps, it was Steinbeck's wife
  Carol who came up with the title, after hearing the song.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>    Steinbeck re the title:
  "...I like it better all the time.  I think it is Carol's best title
  so far.  I like it because it is a march and this book is a kind of march--because ot is in our own
  revolutionary tradition..."  (<em>Working Days</em>,
  p. 169).</p>
<p>The novel reflects many American traits as well, although the
  way Steinbeck portrays them, they too are about morality and the
  spiritual. The plight of the Joads represents the loss of Jeffersonian values of
  attachment to the land, small-scale farming, individualism, and freedom. Absentee landowners led to erosion of
  morality (tractors tearing down homes); loss of land led to human erosion (the Joad family breaks up). Steinbeck's progressive, liberal politics (not communism, which he
  detested) infuse the novel: Large-scale
  institutions (the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company, the banks, the California
  Farmers' Association) oppress the people; the people themselves hold the key to
  change, but not through individualism or self-reliance; only by banding
  together can they throw off the oppressive institutions (the smooth operation
  of the Weedpatch Government camp operations shows
  this very clearly). Steinbeck was not
  calling for outright revolution, but rather for enlightened responses to the
  problems. This "progressive" or
  "liberal" politics, which emerged at the end of the 19th century and the
  beginning of the 20th century and was exemplified on the national level by
  President Theodore Roosevelt, held within it a message to the wealthy: Reform the unintended and unwanted
  consequences of industrial capitalism or face more radical upheavals within
  society. First Jim Casy,
  then Tom Joad becomes the messenger; by rallying
  others to organize, they will raise their voices to a volume that will demand a
  response.</p>
<p><em>Steinbeck
  on Tom: "... Tom - half bitterness, half humane. ... Escapes in the night. Hunted, hunted. Over the last
  pages Tom hangs like a spirit around the camp." </em>(Entry #87,<em> Working Days</em>).</p>
<p>While Tom is clearly an important character (and the essence of
  the novel's main thrust for adapter Frank Galati), Ma Joad is arguably as important a character. Steinbeck was very interested in the evolutionary change from
  matriarchal to patriarchal societies, as outlined by anthropologist Robert Briffault in <em>The
  Mothers: The Matriarchal Theory of Social Origins</em> (New York, 1931). Steinbeck, according to his wife Carol,
  created Ma from Briffault's ideas. In the matriarchal society, the sense of
  belonging to a group revolved around the woman; her brothers often performed
  the duties that in later patriarchal societies the husband and father did. Equality and egalitarianism marked
  matriarchal societies. Because women worked
  hard at various domestic labors (which included directing the economic pursuits
  of the household industries such as tanning, potting, building the home, and
  tool-making), they achieved status and influence within the clan. With the rise of industrialism, however, and
  an attendant emphasis on sexual relations, men gained power and established
  patriarchies. Economic wealth, based on
  individualism and land ownership, overtook the more communal approach of
  matriarchal societies.</p>
<p>But Steinbeck shows (through the characters of Grandpa and Pa Joad particularly) that the patriarchal society, based as
  it was on independence, individualism, and land owning, was no longer capable
  of surviving within the emerging 20th century economy. Beliefs in individualism and private property
  had blinded the men to the fact that large scale corporations held an economic
  advantage over the individual farm owner. <em>Perhaps</em>, Steinbeck suggests
  through the character of Ma Joad, a return to a
  matriarchal society was what Americans needed to do in order to respond to the
  economic situation of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Thus, Ma Joad's matriarchal society
  dovetails with the insights of Jim Casy ("I to we") to suggest that the solution to the problems of the
  migrants rested, at least in part, on the migrants joining together to more
  effectively react to the new economic realities. It is Ma's influence on Tom, as much as Jim Casy's influence, that forces Tom
  to trade-in his male-oriented individualism for a more matriarchal emphasis on
  working together. Adding to the dramatic
  tension, moreover, is the insight that Ma herself does not understand how she
  has influenced Tom; <em>her</em> focus is on
  her family, while her example has shown Tom that a larger family--the migrant
  workers--should be <em>his</em> focus.</p>
<p><em> Steinbeck on Ma: "And I want to build her up as much as possible. Her possibility of an
  organized society. I want to show
  how valuable Ma is to society--what a waste there is." (Entry #68, Working Days)</em></p>
<p><em>"Today
  Ma meets the ladies committee and it must have some charm. It must. It can't flop because here is the great contrast. Here is the tremendous contrast. It must be charming." [Entry #69, Working Days]</em></p>
<p>One other theme is noteworthy (indeed, it caused much
  criticism): Steinbeck constantly put the Joads and the larger story within a larger natural
  world. The sexual antics of Granpa, the turtle (which does not appear in the play), the
  land itself--all of these indicates Steinbeck's belief that humans were only
  part of a larger universe; their actions--like farming the Great Plains--had
  consequences elsewhere in the natural world, just like the actions of uncaring
  large-scale corporations had consequences on families and individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Is the novel representative of history?</strong></p>
<p>Within two months of the novel's publication, Marshal V. Hartsanft published <em>Grapes
  of Gladness: California's Refreshing and
  Inspiring Answers to John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath</em>. In this rejoinder, a migrant family is
  welcomed with open arms to California. In Thormis Miron, <em>The Truth About John Steinbeck and the Migrants</em> (1939), the author posed as a migrant,
  averaged $4 per day, and was asked by the growers to stay on. Steinbeck knew these sorts of attacks were
  forthcoming; but his own experiences gave him the strength to move forward. On the other hand, investigators for Darrell
  Zanuck, who produced the John Ford film of the novel, found conditions to be
  worse than Steinbeck had depicted.</p>
<p>To appreciate how true the novel was, we need to understand the
  relationships between history and fiction, the facts behind the Dust Bowl and
  agriculture in California, the migration patterns of Southwesterners over time, and migrant life. Generally
  speaking, the last half of the novel, the scenes in California, is more
  accurate than the first half; but a certain authenticity still pervades the
  entire novel.</p>
<p>The work is fiction, not history, in the sense that the
  characters are not "real," nor are the various stories factually true. But Steinbeck did not create the characters
  and the plot lines solely from his imagination. He drew from his experiences while traveling in Oklahoma and along Route
  66, but mostly from living in California. As noted above, the government agent, Tom Collins, sent Steinbeck
  statistics from the camp he superintended. But Steinbeck also experienced the migrant camps firsthand (living and
  working in one for several weeks) and was repulsed by what he discovered. In fact, the last scenes representing the
  flood reflected real events that Steinbeck witnessed in February 1938 in
  Visalia and Nipomo, California; arguably, this horrific reality was the final
  push that enabled Steinbeck to produce the masterpiece he had been trying to
  create for several years.</p>
<p>Steinbeck did not attempt to be evenhanded and he made some
  small mistakes. He focused narrowly on
  agriculture and left out other contemporary aspects of the Bear Flag State,
  such as its tremendous urban growth, especially in the southern half of the
  state, and the fact that Mexican and Asian migrants also lived in California. (Indeed, the Mexicans and Asian migrants, who
  had been there first, gave way before the quarter million or so "Okies" who trekked to California in the late 1930s. Once mobilization for war stimulated the
  economy, however, California growers petitioned the government to bring back
  the Mexican migrants.) Some errors do
  appear in the novel. Sallisaw, Oklahoma,
  is located near the Arkansas border, nearly 400 miles to the east of where the
  Dust Bowl actually was, and it lay in a grape growing region. Large corporate farms existed in California
  in the 1930s, but had not yet overtaken the Sooner state.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, mechanization of agriculture, particularly cotton
  production, had advanced the most in the area of the Dust Bowl; 40 percent of
  the farmers, like the Joads, were tenants. Most of the so-called Okies did not leave because of the dust, but rather because they had long since lost
  the ability to make a living off the land. They--not the corporate farms--had worn out the land. (Ironically, New Deal agricultural programs
  pushed even more tenant farmers off the land: In an attempt to control production, the government paid farmers not to
  plant; landowners took the tenant farmers' lands out of production, told them
  to leave, received money from the government for doing so, and continued to
  farm their own land.)</p>

<p>The
  drought of the 1930s began early in the decade in the East--Maryland and
  Virginia. By 1931, portions of Montana
  and the Dakotas had been hit hard. The
  drought then spread from the east in a band southwest to Missouri and Arkansas
  and continued westward throughout the decade. In 1934, the financial loss attributed to the drought equaled one-half
  the cost of U.S. participation in World War I. By the mid-1930s, the southern plains were the most severely hit; the
  rains did not return there until 1941. May of 1934 saw the worst of the dust storms--350 million tons of dirt
  in the air, with 12 million tons falling on Chicago. "Blackouts" lasted from one hour to three and
  one-half days; one could not see one's hands in front of him during the worst
  of these storms. Inhabitants suffered
  from "dust pneumonia" and other respiratory infections. Houses could not be kept clean; the dust came
  in through the smallest of cracks.</p>
<p>The Dust Bowl consisted of 100 million acres, 500 miles North
  to South, 300 miles East to West, and covering land in western Kansas, the
  panhandle of Oklahoma, two-thirds of the Texas Panhandle, northeast New Mexico,
  and southeast Colorado. The Dust Bowl
  existed because human intervention (Muley: "We never should have broke her up")
  exacerbated natural cycles of drought. In the area of the Dust Bowl, mechanization of cotton production had
  advanced further than anywhere else in the Plains states. Less than one-half of the land was owned by
  residents of the state; 40 percent of the farmers were tenants or share
  croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture in California</strong> </p>
<p>While technology exacerbated the effects of the drought in the
  1930s, technology made possible the development of the lush valleys and fruit
  groves in California. Water--and the
  transportation of water--dominated California agriculture. Dams on rivers, especially the Colorado
  River, enabled Californians to capture water; irrigation ditches and canals
  enabled the farmers to transport that water to their farms. Such technology (which in hindsight probably
  did more ecological damage than was necessary) was expensive. And California had higher taxes than other
  farming states. Thus, high costs of
  operations dominated agriculture in California. High costs can be mitigated through combining operations and that is
  exactly what happened in California. Ten
  percent of the farms produced over 50 percent of the crops. This concentrated power in the hands of a
  few. The large-scale farmers controlled
  the California Farmers Association; small-scale farmers discovered that it was
  prudent to follow the dictates of the Association. Another problem faced the farmers: Somewhere in the neighborhood of 175,000
  workers were needed at the peak of the harvest season in California, but most
  of these were not needed during the rest of the year. Coupled with the influx of migrants from the
  Southwest, these facts established the conflicts between the workers and the
  land owners that Steinbeck portrays in his novel.</p>
<p><strong>Migration Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Steinbeck's story of the Joads'
  exodus from Oklahoma contains some truth. But, unstated in the novel is the fact that farmers and others had been
  leaving Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas since World War I, and continued to leave
  during the 1940s; the Dust Bowl did not create a sudden exit from the
  area. For example, as many Southwesterners travelled to California <em>in the 1920s</em> (when rainfall was
  plentiful) as migrated during the dirty thirties, when drought supposedly drove
  off the Joads (about 250,000). <em>Twice
  as many Southwestern migrants</em>, or nearly one-half million, went to
  California in the 1940s, when the economy was much better in the plains states
  than it had been in the 1930s. Thus,
  Steinbeck's emphasis on the drought, while partially correct (indeed, the
  migrants of the 1930s were slightly more poor than the migrants of the 1920s
  because the drought had made them more destitute), is also not totally accurate. Most migrants from the Southwest in the
  1930s, moreover, did not travel very far at all; most moved only to the next
  town or next county. Between 1935 and 1940, Oklahoma lost 309,000 migrants; 142,000 did not
  go far (no farther than contiguous states); 167,000 traveled farther, but not
  all of those went to California.</p>
<p>Other factors pulled the Okies to
  California in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The pull factors were strong and long in the making. California had begun in the 1920s to
  advertise its many attributes--jobs, beautiful scenery, chances to start anew, and, significantly, a mecca for
  vacationing Americans. California
  agriculture needed workers in the 1920s; farmers often paid migrants' railway
  fares to lure them west. And, as with
  all migrating populations in American history, many returned home and extolled
  the virtues of their new land. In fact,
  farmers did not make up a majority of migrants to California in the 1930s. Only 43 percent were farmers, with 21 percent
  being white-collar/professionals, 14 percent unskilled/domestic laborers, 13
  percent semi-skilled/service workers, and 8 percent proprietors or
  professionals. Thus, Connie and Rose of
  Sharon's dreams represented the majority of the migrants' dreams.</p>
<p>Given that the novel was very much a "road novel," were its
  depictions accurate? The Joads appear to have been rather slow travelers, taking
  several months to make the trek of 1,200 miles. Migrants who traveled to California took much less time to do so than
  did the Joads. The average length of a trip from Oklahoma to California, with a decent
  car, was only three or four days. In
  addition, the Joads did not represent a typical
  migrant family. The average Southwestern
  migrant family consisted of 4.4 members. The Joads did not reflect the average ages of
  migrants, either. Out of the twelve
  people in the Joad family, five were over 40. But 60 percent of most migrants were under
  35.</p>
<p>Although Steinbeck did not include in the novel allusions to
  other groups of migrants, he was well aware of the history of migration in
  America and in California. </p>
<p><em>The
  history of California's importation and treatment of foreign labor is a
  disgraceful picture of greed and cruelty. </em>[The Chinese were followed by the Japanese, Mexicans, and
  Filipinos.]</p>
<p><em>Foreign
  labor is on the wane in California, and the future farm workers are to be white
  and American. This fact must be
  recognized and a rearrangement of the attitude toward and treatment of migrant
  labor must be achieved.</em> (<em>Harvest Gypsies</em>, pp. 52, 57).</p>

<p><strong>Migrant Life</strong> </p>
<p>If one has read the novel and done some research on the lives
  of migrants in America, one is struck by how accurate Steinbeck's depictions
  really are (surely a tribute, in part, to his use of Tom Collins'
  information). [For an accessible
  internet site at the Library of Congress, see Selected References/Suggestions
  for Further Reading.] Migrants' lives
  were ones of constant travel, for they needed to look for work and often drive
  some distance to the work that they found. Not surprisingly, information gathered by government researchers in the
  late 1930s and early 1940s reveal a complex community. Some migrants had succumbed to the hazards
  and travails of the road and lost much of their dignity. Many did not. These insisted on staying clean, when possible, and wearing clean
  clothes when engaging in various recreational activities, such as singing,
  playing music, and dancing. Californians, however, who had already established a legally-based
  segregated world separating Anglos from Asians, and who also discriminated
  against Hispanics and African Americans, tended to segregate themselves from
  the Okies; one movie theater sign instructed,
  "Negroes and Okies upstairs."</p>

<p>Many of the Okies were extremely
  religious--holy rollers and Pentecostals particularly. While Steinbeck saw the Okies as being very strong and determined and, indeed, the hope for California's
  future, he could not abide their religious fervor. In fact, this religious fervor conflicted
  with the Democratic Party ideologies behind New Deal programs, especially in
  the government migrant camps. Thus you
  have the scene at Weedpatch (Elizabeth Sandry character). There is in an historical sense, then, a direct thread from the Okies back to the Second Ku Klux Klan of the
  1920s (Oklahoma's government was heavily influenced by the Klan in the
  early-to-mid 1920s) and forward to the Far Right movement of present days. Their religion enabled them to put one foot
  in front of the other and to focus intently on the task at hand--getting work.</p>

<p>In brief summary: The
  novel reflects <em>some</em> of the history of
  the 1930s; other than a few errors in the Oklahoma section, Steinbeck reveals
  much truth in his novel, especially in California. He omits, however, much truth as well (where
  are African Americans? Hispanics? They, too,
  were members of the migrant movement but they are not depicted in the novel).</p>

<h1><a name="The_Film"></a>The Film</h1>
<p>Both John Steinbeck and John Ford fell within the emerging
  documentary tradition of the 1930s, but each chose to employ documentarian
  approaches in different directions. Steinbeck chose to place the Joads within a
  penetrating vision of a larger family of humans, indeed within the larger
  natural world that humans shared with the land, vegetation, and animals. John Ford chose to narrow the documentary
  vision to emphasize the <em>Joad</em><em> family</em>; in so doing, he left out the
  larger connections between the Joads and the land and
  the Joads and society. Ford also encouraged the actors to
  overdramatize the words, which made them less plausible as real, everyday
  people. A rather haphazard movie studio
  system lay behind the production of the film, which explains in part the poor
  results. (That same system, or course,
  accidentally produced the contemporary classic <em>Casablanca</em>). Despite the
  media and Hollywood attention given the film, it is a poor substitute for the
  novel or even Galati's adaptation.</p>
<p><a href="#TOC">Back To Table of Contents</a></p>

<h1><a name="The_Play"></a>The Play</h1>
<p>Frank Galati's work has usually focused on the visual, and often included music; his <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> is no exception. In any play adaptation of a novel, the adaptor must make choices; not
  all material and themes can be replicated on the stage; yet, the adapter should
  stay true to the author's intentions. Most critics believe Galati did this. He chose to fuse the scenes in Oklahoma and on Route 66 into Act I; all
  of Act II occurs in California; this division reflects Steinbeck' choices in
  structuring the novel. While he
  underplays the theme of the land in Act I, Galati does emphasize the various
  people the Joads encountered (although not all of
  them) and other themes from the novel (individualism, community). He does so through dialogue and music; the
  latter conveys themes underplayed in the dialogue and often compresses several
  themes together.</p>
<p><strong>The Adaptor: Frank Galati</strong></p>
<p><img class="portrait" src="images/frank-galati.jpg" width="110" height="125" alt="Frank Galati">
  Frank Galati first thought about
  adapting <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> to the
  stage in the 1970s. He envisioned a
  three-night extravaganza similar to England's <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em>. Once he hooked up with Steppenwolf in the
  1980s (he was still affiliated with the Goodman Theatre), he revisited the
  concept, but made a false step, thinking in terms of a deconstruction of the
  novel that might incorporate contemporary images, be Brechtian-didactic,
  and use images from the 1940 John Ford film. "We had some ideas about Svoboda-like screens, and most definitely a
  turntable--a huge disc of earth, and the truck moved on it. We were very, very smitten by that idea. ... A terrible idea." Then, during a two-week vacation in January 1987, Galati completed most
  of the script. [All quotations in this
  section come from Jonathan Abarbanel, "The Chicago
  Troupe Shoulders a National Epic and Heads West," <em>American Theatre</em> (June 1989), 22-28.]</p>
<p>At the center of his vision
  were the elements fire, water and rain," which together "offered both symbolic
  and architectural symmetry." His
  dramaturgical solution to the interchapters was to
  create musical interludes; Galati "wrote" the lyrics, and Michael Smith created
  the music.</p>
<p>Galati's principle arch was
  straightforward: "Tom is the hero, and
  the result of the conflict is Tom's revelation of Casy's gospel or message. This is offered to
  Tom in the very first scene of the novel, but Tom doesn't get it until he makes
  his last appearance in the story. The
  catalyst is Casy's death--that's the crisis, and it
  leads inexorably to Tom's revelation. So, I started there."</p>
<p>"The locations of the fire and water traps and
  the limited range of motion of the Joad's truck
  pre-ordained the placement of many key scenes. Moving on a track, the truck could pivot on its own axis and move from
  wing to wing, but it could not move upstage or downstage or at a diagonal."</p>
<p>Galati: "We had to figure out how many times the truck was going to stop, and
  where exactly it was going to stop. Kevin [Rigdon--designer] and I went very
  carefully through the show many times to accomplish the sensual images we
  needed. We still wanted earth, air, fire
  and water. That was our governing
  principle."</p>
<p>Galati added different narrators to enhance
  the "vox populi"
  effect. He added humor (especially
  between Grandpa and Al) and the second act square dance to lighten the "awful
  lot of bad news" in the story.</p>
<p> <strong>Play Synopsis</strong></p>
<p> Galati
  put the first one-half of the novel establishing the reasons the Joads were leaving, packing up, and the road trip to
  California in in Act I. All of Act II takes place in California, just
  as in the last one-half of the novel. </p>
<p>In Act I Tom meets up with Casy, and
  for a brief time, Muley,
  reunites with the family, and is informed of the decision to leave. Having bought a Hudson Super Six and
  converted it into a truck, the family packs up and begins the trek along the
  migrants' highway, Route 66. Along the
  way, the family buries Granpa, dreams about California,
  meets The Man Going Back, who suggests that their dreams will be dashed, learn
  the lessons of the road and various camps, and finally arrive in the promised
  land (with only $40), where they bury Grandma.</p>
<p>In Act II, the Joads experience a Hooverville in California, where Floyd Knowles again
  indicates that their dreams will not be fulfilled and Casy takes the blame for a confrontation between Tom and a deputy. They transfer to one of the government camps, Weedpatch, where they learn that working together as
  a community can be successful. Lack of
  work in the area, however, forces them to move on to the Hooper Ranch and a
  private camp. Tom discovers here that Casy has joined a group of migrants on strike. A horrific fight breaks out when a private
  police force attacks the strikers. Tom
  kills the man who killed Casy and he must say goodbye
  to Ma and the family. The family--what
  is left of it--ends up in a boxcar camp, where flooding rains ruin the car and
  force them to move to a barn on higher ground. Rose of Sharon bears a stillborn baby and, in
  the play's (and the novel's) final scene, presents Steinbeck's hope that the
  strong, moral fiber of the migrants will make the future better than the
  present.</p>
<p><strong>Production History</strong></p>
<p> At
  least two other adaptations of the novel have been produced. One was developed by Terence Shank at L.A.'s
  Colony at Studio Theatre Playhouse, 1980; this production was featured at
  Humana Festival of new plays. Another,
  adapted by Peter Whitebrook, premiered at the
  Edinburgh International Festival Fringe in late summer 1987. </p>
<p>Steppenwolf Theatre Company of Chicago first presented <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> at the Royal-George
  Theatre in Chicago in September 1988. La
  Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California, produced the play in May 1989 and the
  Royal National Theatre of Great Britain produced it in London in June
  1989. The Schubert Organization,
  Steppenwolf Theatre Company, and Suntory International Corporation produced the
  Broadway stage version at the Cort Theatre in New
  York City in March 1990. Galati won a
  Tony for his direction and the adaptation won the Tony for Best Play.</p>
<p>Other productions of Galati's adaptation include The Theatre
  Academy of Los Angeles City College, in collaboration with the City Playhouse,
  a then-new resident professional theatre company, 1992; Washington Shakespeare
  Company, Gunston Arts Center in Arlington,
  Washington, 1992; the Cameri Theatre in Tel Aviv,
  Israel, in 1993, in Hebrew ("a colossal flop"); Cal State Fullerton in 1993;
  another English production at the Sheffield Crucible in 1994; Orange Coast
  College in Costa Mesa, CA, in 1994; California Lutheran University in 1994;
  Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts (CA) in 2000; and, the Arkansas
  Repertory Theatre, Little Rock, AK, 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Critics' Views</strong></p>
<p> Below
  I have included extended excerpts and summaries from articles and reviews on
  the Steppenwolf adaptation. In some
  places I have bold-faced interesting comments. In others, I have annotated (in italics) some of the critics' views in
  order to highlight some of the problems associated with adapting and
  understanding an adaptation of an historical novel to the stage.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Jonathan Abarbanel, "The Chicago Troupe Shoulders a National
  Epic and Heads West," <em>American Theatre</em> (June 1989), 22-28.</p>
<p>There was some criticism of the cost of the
  original Chicago production ($500,000), which an AT&amp;T foundation
  bankrolled. "The argument goes that
  accepting corporate money was a violation of Steinbeck's political
  point-of-view in a work in which bosses, banks, and corporate entities are the
  enemies."</p>
<p><em>These critics did not understand
  Steinbeck. He was not
  anti-capitalist. In fact, while writing
  the novel he was very concerned with his own personal finances, was involved in
  the negotiations surrounding his changing publishers, and buying a new
  ranch. Steinbeck refused several
  opportunities to go on the radio or lend his name to causes supporting the
  migrants' plight. Steinbeck did not want
  to eliminate the corporations; he wanted them to act more responsibly. Thus, the corporate sponsorship of Galati's
  adaptation reflects a kind of corporate responsibility Steinbeck would have
  supported. Indeed, his widow strongly
  supported the production, and introduced the PBS broadcast of the play.</em></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Chicago's Steppenwolf Group Adapts 'The Grapes of Wrath,'" <strong>Frank Rich</strong>, <em>New York Times</em>, 6 October 1988, Royal-George Theater, Chicago. [$500,000 budget, 41 performers, 3 hours long]</p>
<p>"... an entirely theatrical work that, at its best, leaves
  the film and even the novel in the dust."</p>
<p>Galati
  planned to continue refining the production, particularly the sluggish first
  act. Galati and scenic designer Kevin Rigdon have "created a stark, brooding stage environment -
  a barnlike shell of dark weathered wood - that smartly makes no attempt to
  compete with the Depression photography of Pare Lorentz or Walker Evans."</p>
<p>"If Mr. Galati has a visual sense that merges
  Thomas Hart Benton with Peter Brook, he also has the literary sense to downplay
  the novel's soupier, sometimes patronizing passages of rustic dialogue."
  [Unlike in the movie, Galati moves Ma's speech forward in the narrative,
  following the novel.] ... "The Steppenwolf adaptation also restores <strong>Steinbeck's harsh portrait of evangelical
  zealots</strong> and, better still, his searing finale." </p>
<p><em>In the Steppenwolf production, black actors
  play the young boy and old man whom the Joads encounter in the barn. I have found no
  evidence that something like this might have occurred. In fact, historical evidence suggests that
  this was most unlikely. Steinbeck had
  little appreciation for people of color and did not include them in the
  novel. Oklahoma was part of the
  segregated South, which again raises questions about Galati's choice here.</em></p>
<p>"Yet
  the play could use more historical detail. <strong>While the novel is a cry of nonideological rage against injustice rather than a highly
  specific radical tract</strong>, Mr. Galati nonetheless overgeneralizes the Okies' economic plight to the extent that the
  uninitiated will not know why the characters are trapped on their long road."</p>
<p>Rich
  noted that it was difficult to overcome Steinbeck's "characters' shallow depth
  and lack of introspection. Here, as in
  Steinbeck, the Joads are symbolic figures from a
  W.P.A. mural: the heartland family in
  extremis. ... the real drama is in their
  circumstances, which gather momentum as slowly as their trucks."</p>
<p>"Perhaps
  no moment is more typical of the production's strengths and failings than the
  one that occurs when Ms. Smith [Ma Joad], having been
  left by Mr. Sinise [Tom Joad],
  remains seated in a pool of dim light on a vast, blackened stage. What does Ma Joad think and feel as she contemplates her son's departure? The play is as frustratingly reticent as the
  novel. But the image of Ma Joad, keeping quiet counsel and strength under the stars,
  reminds us of what still endures in Steinbeck - an indestructible American
  mythology that finds its match in Steppenwolf's brawny pioneering vision of
  American theater."</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"La Jolla's Rich Harvest of 'Grapes,'" <strong>Sylvie Drake</strong>, <em>Los Angeles
  Times</em>, 16 May 1989 La Jolla Playhouse, CA. [35 member cast; 3.5 hours long]</p>
<p>"... it's a tough and
  richly poetic dramatization of the John Steinbeck novel. Emotionally stark, visually bleak and aurally
  sustaining (composer and musical director Michael Smith has created a
  mood-setting musical frame performed on harmonica, a musical harp, banjo,
  fiddle and guitar), this lament for the destitute farmers who left Oklahoma's
  Dust Bowl in the '30s in search of work and survival in California has profound
  resonances in the present. The Okies were the first homeless." </p>
<p><em>This, of course, is incorrect. The U.S. had homeless before the late
  1930s. A decade before Steinbeck was
  born, the first great depression of the 1890s produced Coxey's Army, a movement
  similar to the Bonus Army of 1932 and 1933, a group of homeless demanding
  relief from the Government. John Dos Passos, in </em>The Big Money<em> (1933), had highlighted the homeless through his "Vag"
  character. ("Vag"
  is slang for "vagrant," as in "vag-law" for vagrant
  law. See </em>Woody Guthrie<em>, Library of Congress Recordings, 1988, 3-CD
  collection)</em>.</p>
<p>"The echoes, however, run even deeper --
  backward as well as forward. If the
  itinerant Joads are the quintessence of displaced
  America, they're only an extension of others: the displaced Native Americans and African Americans. </p>
<p><em>This makes some sense, but not in terms of
  what Steinbeck intended; it reflects post-novel interpretation, as well as a
  slow coming of age of American cultural identity.</em></p>
<p>"Thus the desperation of the Joads, trying to stick together and survive in a country
  that (failing other ideas) can think only of exploiting them, informs the
  larger story of a nation set on a socially tragic course, in which the distance
  between the haves and have-nots relentlessly, endlessly widens.</p>
<p><em>This is presentism;
  in the 1930s, I would argue, the fear was the opposite--'would I slip back?';
  yet, see USA Today review below--it states this theme better.</em></p>
<p>Galati's
  adaptation "understands something vitally important: that the only requirement for any play is
  that it be true to its intent. In the
  case of an adaptation, that means the original author's intent. On that level, the Steppenwolf 'Grapes of
  Wrath' succeeds better than its predecessors."</p>
<p>"... it doesn't compromise its bleakness and knows <strong>how to convey the poetry within it --
  exactly as Steinbeck has done</strong>." "... a testament to the rarely seen virtues of ensemble
  performance."</p>
<p>"The
  torn and faded costumes by Erin Quigley and Kevin Rigdon have the drab authenticity of economic condition all over them. The spare lighting and set designs by Rigdon create a deft, depressing mood, at once lyrical and
  stern, with clotheslines replacing the barbed wire in the second half,
  isolating pools of light, recessed bonfires, a waist-deep water channel
  representing the river, white lightning and sheets of rain crashing down to the
  sound of apocalyptic thunder during the rainstorm (Rob Milburn designed the
  sound) -- and of course the truck.</p>
<p>"This key player in the story has to be moved
  around on a special radio-controlled frame. That's the only time that technology hinders rather than helps. But theater is not about realism. <strong>It is
  about poetic illusion</strong>. And, in this
  case, it is also very much about words." </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Stage
  Wire: London Critics Praise 'Grapes of
  Wrath,'" <strong>Dan Sullivan</strong>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, 8 July 1989.</p>
<p>"'As
  shatteringly perfect a piece of American theater as you are likely to
  experience in a lifetime of trans-Atlantic travel,' wrote critic Jack Tinkder in the <em>Daily
  Mail</em>."</p>
<p>"'You
  would have to have a heart carved out of granite not to be moved by this
  magnificent production,' wrote the <em>Sunday
  Express'</em> Clive Hirschlhorn."</p>
<p>"... was praised for retaining its epic quality without
  getting bogged down in rhetoric. Michael Billington of the <em>Guardian</em> thought that in one respect, the stage version improved on the book. 'Speeches that on the page looked sentimental
  or rhetorical, come alive in the mouths of these excellent Chicago actors.' ... Milton Shulman of the <em>Evening
  Standard</em> spoke of the company's '<strong>almost
  balletic precision</strong>.'"</p>
<p>"John Peter in the <em>Sunday Times</em>: 'It is the
  best kind of American acting, gritty and gnarled with a simple rhetoric which
  knows that is has no need of bombast or hysteria. The actors are sharply individualized and yet
  self-effacing.'"</p>
<p>Jeremy Kingston, <em>Times</em>, focused on Sinise: "intense and sinewy"</p>
<p><strong>"Several
  critics also pointed out that 'The Grapes of Wrath' hasn't lost its relevance
  in the 1980s, a time when migrant workers and farm foreclosures are still in
  the news. This made
  Steppenwolf's guest production, not only admirable but, in Billington's view, 'necessary.'"</strong></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Steppenwolf's
  Gritty Honesty Dazzles in Clear, Classic Style," <strong>David Patrick Stearns</strong>, <em>USA
  Today</em>, 23 March 1990, New York</p>
<p>The
  production at the Cort Theater: "More bedraggled and less tuneful than "Les Miserables," this 44-character epic by Chicago's
  Steppenwolf Theatre is too big for Broadway to finance; too unvarnished for the
  matinee crowd."</p>
<p>"The
  actors build performances slowly, emerging out of the spare, colorless set that
  conveys the drab Oklahoma Dust Bowl. Stage effects (campfires, rivers, rain storms) are functional rather
  than spectacular."</p>
<p>"... A nighttime brawl is portrayed by a sea of
  flashlights chaotically stabbing each other in the dark."</p>
<p>"...
  "The Grapes of Wrath" is about a society in which the rich get richer and the
  poor get poorer. It's about how we deal
  with holocaust, and the truth is often heartbreaking."</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Frank Rich again:</strong> "New Era for 'Grapes of Wrath,' <em>New York Times</em>, 23 March 1990. [Cort production]</p>
<p>"It's not just because audiences must step
  around homeless people to get to the theater that the time is right for the
  Steppenwolf Theater Company's majestic adaptation of 'The Grapes of Wrath.'</p>
<p>"... [Steinbeck] was also writing about a
  nation in search of itself. After a
  decade of dog-eat-dog boom and another of Depression, Steinbeck wondered what
  credo the survivors could still believe in. Fifty years later - after another 1920's-style orgy of greed and with
  many bills yet to be paid - Americans are once more uncertain in their faith. While an all-night party celebrating
  democracy is being uncorked around the world, the vast inequities of our own
  democracy leave some Americans wondering whether they deserve to be invited."</p>
<p>"...
  On the surface, 'The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the worst great novels ever
  written. The characters are perishable
  W.P.A.-mural archetypes incapable of introspection, the dialogue is at times
  cloyingly folksy and the drama is scant. ... Steinbeck wasn't trying to be
  Dickens or Hugo or Dreiser. Without
  embracing either a jingoist's flag or a Marxist ideology, he was simply trying
  to unearth and replenish the soul holding a country together. That's the simple, important drama that
  Steppenwolf, with incredibly sophisticated theatrical technique, brings to the
  stage."</p>
<p>"What one finds in place of conventional
  dramatic elements - and in place of the documentary photography possible only
  on film - is pure theater as executed by a company and director that could not
  be more temperamentally suited to their task. As Steppenwolf demonstrated in "True West," "Orphans" and "Balm in
  Gilead" - all titles that could serve for 'The Grapes of Wrath' - it is an
  ensemble that believes in what Steinbeck does: the power of brawny, visceral art, the importance of community, the
  existence of an indigenous American spirit that resides in inarticulate
  ordinary people, the spiritual resonance of American music and the heroism of
  the righteous outlaw. As played by Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney, Tom Joad and the lapsed preacher, Jim Casy - the Steinbeck
  characters who leave civilization to battle against injustice - are the
  forefathers of the rock-and-roll rebels in Steppenwolf productions by Sam Shepard and Lanford Wilson just
  as they are heirs to Huck and Jim. The
  get their hands dirty in the fight for right." </p>
<p>"...
  If he [Galati] has an esthetic model, it is Peter Brook, not 'The Waltons.' His
  'Grapes' looks a lot like the Brook 'Carmen,' for its atmosphere is created
  with the basic elements of earth, water, fire and air. Even so, Mr. Galati and Mr. Rigdon do not regard homespun simplicity as a license for
  improvisatory amateurism. <strong>Elegance may seem an odd word to apply to
  'The Grapes of Wrath,' but it fits this one. While a stage production cannot compete with the photography of Walker
  Evens or Pare Lorentz, it can emulate the rigorous, more abstract painterly
  imagery of Edward Hopper or Thomas Hart Benton or Georgia O'Keefe.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Though
  trimmed since its premiere in Chicago in 1988, Act I ... still requires
  perseverance. Mr. Galati, like
  Steinbeck, demands that the audience sink into a jerky, episodic journey rather
  than be propelled by the momentum of character or story. Act II pays off with the flood sequence
  - ... <strong>When Ma Joad ... delivers her paean to the people's ability to 'go on,' it isn't the
  inspirational epilogue that won Jane Darwell an Oscar
  but a no-nonsense, conversational reiteration of unshakable pragmatism. When Mr. Sinise leaves his already disintegrated family to join a radical underground, his
  'I'll be all around in the dark' soliloquy is not Fonda's Lincolnesque address but a plain-spoken statement of bedrock conviction.</strong>"</p>
<p>"... the tableau is religious theater in the simplest
  sense."</p>
<p>"Some of the audience seemed to be weeping,
  too, and not out of sadness, I think. <strong>The Steppenwolf 'Grapes of Wrath' is true
  to Steinbeck because it leaves one feeling that the generosity of spirit that
  he saw in a brutal country is not so much lost as waiting once more to be
  found."</strong></p>

<p>"Steppenwolf

<p>"Because
  he [Steinbeck] found aching, timeless truths about human endurance in times of
  crisis, his tale has never faded into the safe perspective of history."</p>

<p>"...

  fits this emotion-laden tale of the impoverished."</p>
<p>"The

  Production of 'Grapes of Wrath,'" <strong>Kevin

<p>"Purer
  in its poverty, less of a grandstanding expose, this 'Grapes of Wrath' is even
  an improvement on the novel. Frank
  Galati ... has reduced Steinbeck's famous intercalary chapters to a few
  cohesive lines. And the result is a
  drama that takes hold in its opening moments and doesn't let go until the end."</p>
<p>"Galati understands the material's elemental
  appeal, the awful, dehumanizing struggle of the Joad family to escape from the calcified earth to a fallow future, from certain
  death to the promise of life. Striking
  out Steinbeck's self-conscious symbolism, cutting back on the historical sweep
  and, perhaps best of all, restraining the allegory, Galati has come up with his
  own kind of fidelity. He lets the book
  speak for itself."</p>
<p>"...
  Galati errs once. He uses no less than
  four narrators who, taciturn, as they are, sometimes mouth material so incidental
  it's worthless. Despite this minor flaw,
  and it is minor, what we have here is 'The Grapes of Wrath' enriched."</p>
<p><strong>Other Productions by Frank Galati</strong></p>
<p><em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> was not Frank Galati's first nor his last historical
  adaptation. In the mid-1970s, Frank
  Galati directed a musical adaptation of Mike Royko's book, <em>Boss</em>, a biography of Chicago
  Mayor Richard J. Daley. In 1988, he
  re-staged Grason Kanin's 1945 play, <em>Born Yesterday</em>, which
  reflected wartime corruption in the nation's capital. In 1988, he moved on to Hollywood and
  co-wrote, with Lawrence Kasdan, the screenplay for <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>. (Interestingly, David Q. Combs, who plays Casy in CATCO's production, played a preacher in that
  film!) Galati has directed Shakespeare (<em>Winter Tale</em>, 1990, Goodman Theatre,
  Chicago) and that same year conceived and directed "She Always Said, Pablo," a
  mixture of images and paintings (Pablo Picasso), music (Virgil Thomson and Igor
  Stravinsky), words (Gertrude Stein), and dance. The Goodman produced this offering at the Kennedy Center Opera House to
  disappointing box office returns.</p>
<p>In 1991, Galati adapted Anne Tyler's novel, <em>Earthly Possessions</em>, with the
  Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Frank Rich,
  of <em>The New York Times</em>, wrote that
  "The qualities that Mr. Galati brought to 'The Grapes of Wrath' are all
  apparent in 'Earthly Possessions': the
  keen visual sense, the scrupulous respect for the language and intentions of
  his literary source, the conviction that even the most intimate drama can have
  a cinematic sweep on stage. As the Joads' truck dominated the last Galati production, Jake's
  getaway car is usually at the center of 'Earthly Possessions,' with the
  homesick restaurants and lonely Edward Hopper vistas on its route filled in by
  animated, black-and-white slide projections (by John Boesche)
  in a funky Jim Jarmusch style." [<em>NYT</em>,
  4 September 1991 Section C, p 13]</p>
<p>In 1992, Galati ("a renowned refugee, as it were, from the
  so-called legitimate theater"--Martin Bernheimer, LA Times, 21 September 1992,
  Part F, p. 1) directed Puccini's opera, "Tosca," in San Francisco, at the War
  Memorial Opera House, with Tony Walton on set design. Alas, it was a "clumsy, contrived and
  confusing" production. In 1993, Galati
  adapted and directed (at the Goodman) Maxwell Anderson and Kurt Weill's "Lost
  in the Stars," (1949) "a musical tragedy," retitled "Cry, the Beloved Country." Dealing with
  race in South Africa, this production called for compassion from men of all
  colors. [David Richards, NYT, 25 July 1993, Sunday, Sec 2, p. 5]</p>
<p>In 1994, Galati directed Tennessee Williams' <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> (1945) for the
  Roundabout Theatre Co. in New York City, with Calista Flockhart and Julie Harris. [David Richards, NYT, 16
  November 1994, Sec. C, p. 17]</p>
<p>In 1995, Galati and Steppenwolf staged William Faulkner's <em>As I Lay Dying</em> in Chicago. Dealing with rural poverty Mississippi 1930s,
  the play contrasted with "The Grapes of Wrath" adaptation. David Patrick Stearns [USA TODAY, 9 August
  1995]: "While Steinbeck had a highly
  visual style, Faulkner tended to go straight into his characters' souls, often
  without telling us who they are or how they connect to each other. ..." </p>
<p>In 1999, Galati directed another adaptation of an
  historical-novel at the Colonial Theatre in Boston (produced by Pace Theatrical
  Group and Broadway)--the musical adaptation by Terrence McNally of E. L.
  Doctorow's novel, <em>Ragtime</em>. [Ed Siegel, <em>The</em><em> Boston Globe</em>, 22 January 1999, ARTS &amp; FILM, D1]</p>

<h1><a name="Catco_Approach"></a>CATCO's Approach to the Production</h1>
<p>Given all of the above,
  and the physical layout and size of the Riffe Center
  Studio One Theatre, director Geoff Nelson, assistant director Maureen Ryan,
  scenic designer Dan Gray, lighting director T. J. Gerckens, costumer Cindy
  Turnbull, musical director Tammy Hansan, sound
  designer Brian Kallaher, props master Elizabeth
  Langford, and the cast and production crew had to make choices. One overriding goal was to make CATCO's
  production "fresh," and not to give in to expectations.</p>
<p>From an initial "approach"
  outlined by Nelson, the collaborative approach taken at CATCO, where <em>everyone</em> is encouraged to participate in
  shaping the production, was designed to bring forth a
  rich and fresh approach to the classic American story.</p>

<p><strong>CATCO --Quick Production FACTS</strong></p>
<p><em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is CATCO's largest production to date.</p>
<p>Twenty-three actors, two musicians, two
  assistant stage managers (one who doubles as an actor), and two backstage
  runners join the Stage Manager and lighting and sound board operators for each
  performance.</p>
<p>The two musicians play guitar, fiddle, harp, and
  saw (which the musician learned for this production). Four actors join the
  musicians with other instruments: washtub base, harmonicas (2), and banjo.</p>
<p>Costumes: There are 90 different characters
  depicted on stage. On average, each actor has at least two costumes; one has
  seven costume changes.</p>
<p>Props: There are over 230 different props,
  ranging from barrels to crates to guns to bundles of clothing and eating
  utensils. One of the assistant stage managers "tracks" each prop and
  knows where it is at all times.</p>
<p>Specialists: In addition to the usual lighting
  and sound directors, CATCO hired a music director, a choreographer, and a
  fight-movement director (who doubles as an actor).</p>
<p>CATCO's budget for this production was about <strong>one-fifth</strong> the budget of the original Steppenwolf production.</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Nelson The Director's Approach</strong></p>
<p><img class="portrait" src="images/geoff-nelson.jpg" width="121" height="156" alt="Geoff Nelson">Geoff Nelson, Founder and Artistic Director of CATCO, handed out
  the following "approach" to all cast and crew members at the first rehearsal.</p>
<p>GRAPES is the
  biggest production that CATCO has ever staged biggest not only in the number of
  performers onstage (twenty-five) but more so in terms of story. We don't have a
  simple action here, with a single protagonist; we have instead a complex,
  interwoven series of actions involving an entire family as protagonist. The
  power of this play lays in this very <em>epic </em>quality: the audience becomes involved in <em>all </em>the separate plot lines of the Joad family. It is also <em>epic </em>because the Joads represent "The People," the working class
  family that has so little voice in America then and now. And it is <em>epic </em>because of the sheer cumulative
  power of twenty-five performers.</p>
<p>The idea of
  "The People" is at the heart of this production. Our premise is that
  the ensemble all twenty&#8209;five of you,
  representing "The People" tell us the story of the Joads. Some of you step out of the Ensemble to become
  individual Joads, others play a variety of the people they encounter on
  their Odyssey. Dead Joads disappeared Joads are recycled and come back to play other people.</p>
<p>[A note here on
  costuming and makeup: There's a lot of doubling in this show and we're
  certainly not trying to fool the audience. When the actor
  playing Connie Rivers returns to the stage as a striker the costume will make
  it clear that this is a different person. But it will be up to the actor
  to find a different physicality, vocalization, temperament, etc.]</p>
<p>This idea of
  "The People" animates the casting and musical assignments as well.
  I'd like to spread the telling of the story among many performers. Our skilled
  musicians will necessarily carry the bulk of the music, but we are also looking
  for places where a few of the actors who play instruments or sing take on a
  number. I have also replaced the largely male narrators in the original script
  with purely female narrators. There's a wonderful image in the book: the men squatting in a circle to make big
  decisions, while the women stand with the children on the periphery waiting. At
  the end of this play, though, the women clearly provide much of the strength
  that keeps us going.</p>
<p>This is not the
  Steppenwolf Production. We don't have the resources, nor the space, to fly scenery nor to store a real truck. Galati's original
  production used real fire, real tanks of water, real rain and we <em>could </em>probably do that. But instead we
  have chosen a more <em>theatrical </em>approach.</p>
<p>One of the
  interesting elements in the script is the idea of <em>transformation </em>how the band's music becomes the sound of the engine
  stalling, how the jaw harp becomes a heartbeat, how the square dancers become
  the strikers, etc. In our production this concept will guide a lot of the
  staging. Music or live sound effects will create the effect of mimed shoveling
  (no real dirt) when Grandpa is buried; actors and long pieces of cloth will
  create the Colorado River; the barn at the end will be created by the Ensemble
  holding planks, etc. We don't have all the details worked out, but my
  expectation is that we will use the Ensemble and music and live sound effects
  more than the Steppenwolf Production.</p>
<p>The settings will
  also be created out of a lot of the same units that will be re-used in
  different ways, as well as with new scenic pieces. The truck as Dan will
  explain is created largely out of non-truck parts--again, the idea of <em>transformation.</em></p>
<p>The scene changes
  in this play will be big production numbers, accomplished by the Ensemble
  rather than by technology. These scene changes are usually accompanied by songs
  or text. There are also a number of crowd scenes where the Ensemble will be
  actively involved in creating distinct, believable characters who don't speak and aren't listed in the script! When I say
  that the cumulative impact of twenty&#8209;five actors will help create that <em>epic </em>feeling
  in the audience, it is because the Ensemble will be such a strong presence
  onstage from first to last. (In the Steppenwolf production, the ensemble and
  the music petered out as the story progressed. Not here.)</p>
<p>One staging note:
  we will be using the full auditorium. Moments will be staged out in the house.
  I think it's important for the audience to enhance that feeling of scale and
  space.</p>
<p>And a few words
  on some central acting issues....</p>
<p>If we play the Joads as victims, the production will fail. The goal is not
  for the audience to feel sorry for this family. The goal is for the audience to <em>admire </em>them, to be in awe of their
  strength and generosity and perseverance.</p>
<p>The important
  thing is not what happens to the Joads, but how they
  respond, how they change as a result of what they experience. They are not
  whiners. They are a tough, hard-working, proud (sometimes too proud) people who
  put a very, very high value on self-reliance.</p>
<p>At heart, this
  play is about values about one family and how its values (self-reliance,
  family, religion) change. How <em>community, </em>how responsibility for your fellow man becomes crucial
  to them. How "I" becomes "We." It's a movement from
  ignorance to knowledge. It's also the recognition of how one gains power over
  one's own life from being part of a powerful group. In the end, self-reliance
  is an illusion. And family values are only significant if they are supported by
  community values.</p>
<p>Be careful of
  playing sentiment. Rarely do these people have the time, or inclination, to sit
  around and feel sorry for themselves. This is THE GRAPES OF <em>WRATH, </em>remember, not ANATOMY OF
  MELANCHOLY. These are also people who distrust sentiment as a sign of weakness:
  if you let yourself be emotional you're done for, you won't have the strength
  to fight on </p>
<p>The humor in the
  play is crucial. It counterpoints all the hard stuff, which would get
  unbearable without it.</p>
<p>For the Ensemble:
  don't play everyone as villains. The worst people the Joads encounter are rarely conscious of who they are and what they do. They think
  they are right, that they are justified. They are driven by fear, or need, or
  mistaken notions. Find the positive side of these characters it will make their
  actions all the harder</p>
<p>And finally and
  most importantly: be honest. You are speaking for people who had (and have)
  little voice in our culture.</p>
<p><strong>Scenic Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan Gray</strong>, Resident Scenic
  Designer and Assistant Professor<br />
  Department of Theatre, The Ohio State University</p>
<p>Transformation, adaptation, and determination
  were essential to the Joad's survival in a harsh
  world.  These qualities drove and defined the scenic approach to our
  production.</p>
<p>Conceptually, my initial scenic-design response
  to <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> was driven by some very practical concerns.
  How would we create a space that would support a cast of 25 people, a truck to
  transport 13 of them to California, and a sense of the expansive vistas of the Joad's journey on a relatively small stage?  How could
  we show the desperation and transformation of these characters in a way that
  reflected the realities they encountered day after day?  The answer to
  these and other questions came from the texts--John Steinbeck's novel and the
  Frank Galati-Steppenwolf adaptation.</p>
<p>The novel is a story of real characters (who
  have all seen better days) told in simple, direct language.  The stage
  environment would have to reflect this straightforward approach. Honest
  materials, worn and blown raw by the elements, would frame this world.
  The stage would be a wide open space with a series of levels to create a varied
  palette for composing our performers. Different locations would be suggested by
  elements found within the environment and manipulated by the actors.  We
  would make no pretense of hiding the theatrical nature of our communication
  with the audience.  Large scenic changes made by unseen hands and other
  "theatre tricks" had no place in this production.</p>
<p>The famous "Joad Truck" would also be created in this manner.  Practically, we had no
  room for even a scaled down version of a Hudson Super Six on (or off!)
  stage.  We needed to find a way of suggesting this emblematic vision of
  migration in a way that was consistent with the approach we had embraced.
  In my research for the production I saw many video and still images of Okies fleeing to California with their belongings strapped
  all over their vehicles.  I was struck by the idea that in many cases you
  couldn't really see the vehicle for all the stuff that surrounded it.
  This would prove to be the key to our truck.  We would create the
  suggestive silhouette of a period Hudson on a roving platform with items from
  the destroyed Joad place.  A round top trunk
  formed the engine bonnet; a bench made the seat; fence pieces defined the truck
  bed; a headboard separated the cab from the bed of the converted car-into-a
  truck. Most of these items could then be used as props in other scenes as
  needed. Thus, the truck reflected the themes of transformation, adaptation, and
  determination.</p>
<p><strong>Costume Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cindy Turnbull</strong>, Assistant
  Professor of Theatre and Resident Costume Designer<br />
  Department of Theatre, Denison University</p>
<p>As Costume Designer for <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> I have had many
  challenges. There are over 90 characters acting in diverse locations from
  Oklahoma to New Mexico to Arizona and California. I am focusing on the
  "clothes" of the period and making these garments look worn, lived
  in, and authentic to the 1930's and the characters. I am also working with
  textures of all kinds, combinations, and different colors. All of this must be
  created within the time, labor, and money constraints that all theatrical
  artists work within.</p>
<p>My general process in designing is:</p>
<p>Read the script several times</p>
<p>Research using period sources</p>
<p>Prepare character analysis of all characters within the show</p>
<p>Draw preliminary sketches and get feedback from the director</p>
<p>Make changes to the sketches</p>
<p>Shop for fabric for garments we are constructing</p>
<p>Shop for garments at thrift stores</p>
<p>Fit the actors in their costumes</p>
<p>Build and alter garments</p>
<p>Laura Dana is Costume Shop Supervisor at CATCO and is doing a
  wonderful job overseeing the building and construction of the costumes. She
  also organizes the fast changes and running of the show as it goes into dress
  rehearsals.</p>
<p>In this production process, I am also serving as the dyer/painter.
  To achieve the worn, tattered, and dirty look of some of the clothes, I am
  painting them with dye and over dying some of them to create a faded look. I
  had to purchase new denim pants for some of the men and I have bleached and
  faded them so that they look old and lived-in.  After the dyeing and painting is done sandpaper
  and cheese graters are used to fray the fibers. This also adds a
  three-dimensional texture to the garments.  Other textures I am working
  with include fabrics with stripes, plaids, and prints and different weights and
  drapes of fabrics. This variation creates a visual variety and an earthy
  quality for the characters. Sometimes there are even stripes and prints used
  within the same costume.</p>
<p>Creating the world of the characters and clothes that make sense
  in that world is my goal. But this production is not reality, not real life; it
  is its own theatrical and artistic statement based on the visions of the
  various artists working on it. I want the clothes to say something about the
  characters that might help the audience understand the story a little better.
  This is subtlety at its finest. No sequins or metallic fabrics are found in
  this show. I hope all audience members discover themselves transported back in
  time over sixty years ago and that, without consciously noticing, the costumes
  blend into that world created on stage.</p>
<p><strong>Musical Direction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tammy Hansan</strong></p>
<p>Since the founding of our country, music has
  provided our society with reasons to believe.  Music continues to carry
  the country from the protest songs during the civil rights and antiwar
  movements through the global activism we see today.  Civil rights activist
  and musician Harry Belafonte said, " Wherever I go in
  the world and I look for forces that are struggling against injustice, I always
  seem to find somebody with a guitar and a voice and they're always singing to
  something that inspires the community, no matter how ravaged that community may
  be."  The Joads came from a
  community ravaged by Mother Nature and big corporations; the same community
  that triggered Woody Guthrie to create songs of desperation, songs of hope and
  songs of promise.<br />
   <br />
  I chose the music used in CATCO's production of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> to
  do several things.  First, generally it reflects the attitudes and
  emotions of the Joads. For example, "The
  Waltz," heard throughout the play, serves as Ma's memories of the past,
  the security she finds in her family and the promise of a better life.
  Woody Guthrie's "Goin; Down This Road" is
  presented as traveling music and helps give the sensation of the Joads' truck rambling across the country on Route 66.
  Other Guthrie tunes, such as "Dust Bowl Blues" and "Mountain
  Railroad," reveal how closely Woody's own life parallels the lives of the Joads.  Second, the music helps carry forward the
  action of Frank Galati's adaptation.  Third, in some cases the lyrics help
  fill-in sections from the novel that could not be included in the production
  without making the saga too long for the audience.</p>

<p><strong>Props</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Langford</strong></p>
<p>The biggest responsibility of the properties
  master is to be as realistic and historically accurate as possible. The
  challenge, as is normal for any period play, is finding items currently
  available that are close enough to what was used "at that time"
  (e.g., cotton clothes line, wooden clothes pins or the red rags gas station
  attendants used to use). Conveying the desperation these people went through
  and the fact that they were not always destitute, that they had been prosperous
  before they lost their farm, and that they were proud were key goals to meet.
  Their belongings should show extreme overuse, worn down by the elements; but
  they also needed to look as if they were nice things at one time in the past.
  Magazines of the day (<em>Saturday Evening Post</em>,<em> Life</em>,<em> Look</em>,<em> Good Housekeeping</em>) and photographs from the Dust Bowl (especially by
  Dorothea Lange) were particularly helpful in revealing the types of things
  people used in the 1930s--what kinds of dishes, pots and pans, baskets,
  appliances of any type, what products were available (i.e. Morton Tender- Quick
  for salting the pork, Havoline oil used by the gas
  station attendant). Photos of the fleeing Okies in
  their trucks loaded down with all of their worldly possessions were
  particularly helpful in "loading" the Joad truck. The trick, given the limited amount of space and the number of people
  needing to be in that space, was to make it look as if the Joads took everything but the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Shopping the antique/vintage shops and thrift
  stores usually turns up many treasures.</p>
<p>As with the costumes, items purchased new must
  be distressed. For example, the plates for "supper" were new pie
  plates. I sprayed them down with black spray paint first, then used a
  combination of other colors of paint for texture and finally gave them the
  "well-worn" look with a hammer. The slabs of "salt pork"
  were made using several layers of foam of different thickness, modeling clay,
  and a lot of glue.</p>
<p>In creating the world of the Joads and the other displaced people they meet on their trip to California, as well
  as the migrant life in California, the use and re-use of all props and set
  pieces to build the truck and define the locations (Hooverville, Weedpatch Camp, etc ) is
  reminiscent of the migrants' use and re-use of items, sometimes to the point of
  wearing them out.</p>

<h1><a name="What_Happened_to_Okies"></a>What Happened to the Okies?</h1>
<p>According to Jules Loh,
  a California journalist in the early 1990s, Ma Joad's prediction that the Okies would simply go on actually
  understated their impact on California. For example, Dale Scales (who was 57 in 1992), and who was a baby in
  1936 when his family of six arrived in Bakersfield, owned 1800 acres, which he
  leased out, and made "his living trading in huge tracts of farmland for
  corporate investors, lives in the highest hill in Bakersfield, keeps a $45,000
  custom car in the garage and golfs at the country
  club." Perhaps as many
  as one-eighth of California's population in 1992 could trace ancestry to the Okies--about 3.75 million. Many had stayed on in California when
  mobilization for World War II presented good job opportunities.</p>
<p>A native Californian who
  witnessed the Okie invasion in the 1930s, Doris
  Weddell, "watched her native valley [San Joaquin Valley] ... steadily take on
  manners and folkways of the rural Southwest that weren't there before."  "The churches illustrate one obvious change.
  ... When I was a girl in Modesto there
  were five -- Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Presbyterian and Episcopalian. Now only the Catholic Church is
  prominent. It serves the Mexicans,
  today's Okies. Now we have Pentecostals, Evangelicals, various fundamentalist
  congregations, and there are scads of them all over the valley. What used to be the main-line churches are
  almost insignificant." The infamous Weedpatch government camp of the novel (actually titled
  Arvin Labor Camp) was still in operation in 1992. Established in 1937 by the FSA with concrete
  floors and tents, it had improved by the 1990s to include two-bedroom plywood
  houses that sheltered 130 families; signs were in Spanish. [Jules Loh,
  "California's Okies," 15 October 1992, <em>The Press-Enterprise</em>, E-11.]</p>

<h1><a name="Migrants_in_Ohio"></a>Migrants in Ohio</h1>
<p>The plight of the Joads as depicted in <em>The
  Grapes of Wrath</em> was a universal one. Only the particular crops and the background of migrants in other areas
  differed. The economic forces behind
  agriculture in Ohio were not all that different from those in California,
  although sugar beets and onions comprised the major crops in Ohio for which
  casual workers were needed (for weeding several times a year and for the final
  harvest). A handful of large-scale
  agribusinesses dominated the state's agriculture and the small-scale farmer
  found it difficult to compete. The
  small-scale farmers could not even match the below-poverty wages that the
  large-scale farmers offered to the migrant laborers. The farmers complained to the state
  government, but received little help. There appeared to be among the small-scale Ohio farmers a greater sense
  of concern for the plight of the migrants, but they did not have the resources
  to furnish a decent, living wage. </p>
<p>In Ohio, migrants from
  Appalachia and from Mexico dominated the farm laboring community. Those from Appalachia, particularly from
  Kentucky, were very similar to the Joads: religious, prideful, family-oriented,
  hard-working. Those Ohioans who knew of
  the migrants treated them, like Californians did the Okies,
  with disdain and misunderstanding. Ohioans saw migrants as a burden on local relief rolls, as choosing
  their existence out of ignorance. When
  migrants remained in the area, crime rates did increase. And the migrants tended to bring their
  inter-family feuds with them, thus sparking an increase in violence when they
  were out of work. For the most part,
  however, the Ohio migrants were unseen to most Ohioans until a strike caught
  the attention of the state's press. The
  strike began in June 1934 in Hardin County, in the marshes that provided good
  soil for onions. Local law enforcement
  officials joined private citizens and the Ohio National Guard to break the
  strike. Riots occurred in Alger; local
  citizens captured and beat the leader of the strikers. Eventually, strike-breakers left the area and
  the migrants returned to the fields, but without having won any of their
  demands for better pay and housing conditions. After that was settled, however, the migrants became invisible once
  again to most Ohioans. The onion fields
  proved less profitable, and Mexican migrants began to supplant the Appalachian
  workers. The story of the Mexicans,
  alas, repeated that of the Appalachians.</p>

<p>How does the concept of the American Dream lace

<p> Does Steinbeck believe that capitalism has
