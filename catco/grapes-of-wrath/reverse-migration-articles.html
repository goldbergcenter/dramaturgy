  <h5><span style='color:black'>By Phillip Reese | Sacramento Bee</span></h5>
  <p><span style='color:black'>OKLAHOMA CITY — Fleeing the Great Depression and a
    drought unprecedented in American history, a vast wave of Oklahomans and Texans
    dubbed &quot;<span class=SpellE>Okies</span>&quot; loaded everything they could
    onto crowded vehicles during the 1930s and headed west for California. Today,
    in huge numbers, their grandchildren are moving back. </span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>It doesn't take Loren <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span> much time to come up with a reason why, in between bites of a burger at an
    Oklahoma City diner. &quot;There aren't really people lined up on the streets
    here competing for a few scraps,&quot; said <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span>,
    23, who grew up in Sacramento but recently graduated from Oklahoma Christian
    University and opted to stay put. &quot;Small businesses thrive here because
    networking is so easy.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>As California housing prices went wild in the
    middle of this decade, hundreds of thousands of residents scratched their heads
    and moved to places where homes were still affordable, state and federal
    statistics show. When prices started falling and unemployment started rising,
    many continued to leave California for healthier job markets. </span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>The result was five consecutive years when
    California saw more residents going to other states than coming. Although many
    stayed closer to home – Nevada, Oregon, Arizona – the mid-South saw a large
    influx.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>From 2004 through 2007, about 275,000 Californians
    left the Golden State for the old Dust Bowl states of Oklahoma and Texas, twice
    the number that left those two states for California, recent Internal Revenue
    Service figures show. In fact, the mid-South gained more residents from
    California during those four years than <span class=GramE>either Oregon</span>,
    Nevada or Arizona. The trend continued into 2008.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>As a result, it's easy to find Californians – even
    former <span class=SpellE>Sacramentans</span> – living and working in Oklahoma
    City, a capital of the American heartland.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Ask these <span class=SpellE>Okies</span>-in-reverse
    why they traded the Golden State for the Sooner State – named for settlers who
    came there sooner than the Homestead Act allowed – and you'll hear a lot of
    similar themes: easier to find a job; cheaper to buy or rent a home; better
    place to make a fresh start. Ask them why they stay in Oklahoma and they'll add
    to that list a deep optimism that it's a place where things are about to take
    off.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oklahoma City is like Sacramento back when
    the Kings were in the playoffs,&quot; said <span class=SpellE>Branddon</span> Jones, 26, who moved about a year ago to get out of Del Paso Heights. &quot;It's
    growing. You can get a job. It's just crazy.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>Two different cities</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>A lot of that has to do with the downtown core,
    particularly an area called <span class=SpellE>Bricktown</span> where, on a
    recent Thursday, former <span class=SpellE>Sacramentan</span> Tim Higgins sat
    on a restaurant patio, watching water taxis weave through a nearby canal.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Around Higgins was a vast collection of old
    warehouses that sat abandoned as recently as 15 years ago. That was before the
    city's residents – though relatively conservative – passed a temporary 1-cent
    sales tax increase to improve downtown; before the funds from that tax increase
    built a baseball stadium, an arena (now occupied by an NBA team), a canal and a
    library; before at least 1,000 new housing units sprang up within walking
    distance of where Higgins was sitting.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Now those warehouses are warrens of shops and
    eateries, cozying up to the meandering canal.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;This would be the equivalent of Old
    Sacramento,&quot; said Higgins, 47, &quot;except <span class=GramE>it's</span> much more happening.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>From the restaurant patio, Higgins could see a
    large crane working. Just to his south, workers toiled on a massive project to
    move a federal interstate away from downtown to make way for a park.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>The bustle is very different from what Higgins, a
    videographer, witnessed back home before he moved out in October.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;When I left, all construction had stopped
    throughout California,&quot; he said. &quot;Here I see a lot of construction, a
    lot of new businesses.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>Slow and steady</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Watching tax revenues gush into California city
    coffers as housing prices skyrocketed a few years ago, Oklahoma City Mayor Mick
    Cornett couldn't avoid a twinge of envy. He doesn't feel that way now. </span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Oklahoma City didn't boom, and it's not busting.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Things aren't perfect, but unlike Sacramento,
    there have been no city employee layoffs, nor are any being discussed. Unlike
    Sacramento, Oklahoma City does not face a giant budget deficit.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;We're flat,&quot; the mayor said.</span></p>
  <p><span class=GramE><span style='color:black'>And for next year?</span></span><span
style='color:black'> &quot;We're projecting slight growth.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>The metro area of 1.2 million grows by a
    percentage point or two every year, its housing prices keep up with inflation
    and its businesses tend to expand at a sustainable pace.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Oklahoma City's economy is diverse, but its three
    biggest drivers are energy, government and defense, industries that generally
    tend to be stable. Several of the largest natural gas companies in the nation
    are based here. So is Tinker Air Force Base, which employs tens of thousands.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Add to that some quality of life measures: little
    traffic, almost as many days of sunshine as Sacramento and residents widely
    regarded as among the <span class=GramE>nation's</span> friendliest.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>But the city does have its downsides, according to
    several of the Sacramento refugees. The weather can be random, even dangerous
    when tornadoes sweep through. Mass transit is woefully inadequate. There's far
    less ethnic or cultural diversity than in California. And Oklahoma City is
    seriously landlocked, a full day's drive from the nearest coastline.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>The recession also is starting to bite. Oklahoma's
    unemployment rate has jumped in the last year to about 6 percent.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>All about jobs</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Unemployment in California, however, now stands at
    11 percent, nearly twice Oklahoma's. It doesn't take an economist to figure out
    which state offers more options to job seekers.</span></p>
  <p><span class=SpellE><span style='color:black'>Branddon</span></span><span
style='color:black'> Jones certainly thinks his luck has improved since leaving
    Sacramento. He joined the Army as a cook after graduating from Grant High in
    2001. Three years later, his mom died, and he came back to his hometown.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>A father himself by then, Jones struggled to make
    it in Del Paso Heights and, later, south Sacramento. He had a brush with the
    law – a weapons charge. He worked some decent, low-skill jobs but could barely
    afford rent. His dad, meanwhile, was making a good wage in Oklahoma City.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Jones thought about his life in 10 years, the
    lives of his three young daughters in 10 years, and he saw himself working the
    same types of jobs and living in the same places. He felt like he couldn't
    catch a break.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;You've got to have something to make it out
    of there,&quot; he said, referring to south Sacramento and Del Paso Heights.
    &quot;In Oklahoma City, if you just wake up every morning and do what you are
    supposed to do, you won't have any problems.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>After arriving in 2008, Jones quickly found a few
    good jobs to choose from. Generally he has found pay comparable to California,
    but there are a couple of key differences, he said.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>If he feels like he is being mistreated or
    cheated, Jones said, he can shrug his shoulders, quit and quickly find
    something else just as good. He did that recently when he said a boss didn't
    follow through with a promised raise.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>Affordable housing</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>More importantly, Jones said, his money stretches
    a lot further. A gas station clerk in Oklahoma makes about $1.50 an hour less
    than a gas station clerk in California. But Jones takes his money from working
    behind the counter and spends $400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment. In Del
    Paso Heights, a similarly sized apartment could easily cost $750.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>That's where the similarity ends, too. Jones is
    not living in the Oklahoma City equivalent of Del Paso Heights. He lives a
    short drive from a large city lake, not far from a vibrant commercial strip
    featuring a Romano's Italian Grill and a Chuck-E-Cheese.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>All three of his kids, ages 3, 6 and 8, live with
    him, and they love it. Jones, who is separated from his wife, said his family
    is safer here than in his old neighborhood – he prefers the occasional threat
    of a tornado to the sound of gunshots in the evening.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Tim Higgins has swankier digs. He sleeps on the
    12th floor of a downtown high-rise in a one-bedroom apartment. Yet he pays just
    slightly more than $800 a month in rent, including utilities. </span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;When I arrived here, I managed to get a
    local phone number, a local bank account and an apartment in a secured downtown
    building – all in one hour,&quot; Higgins said. &quot;I don't know anywhere
    else where that would happen that quickly.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Higgins also came to Oklahoma in pursuit of
    opportunity. He had spent 15 years running video and audio at Arco Arena,
    including for the Sacramento Kings. They parted ways in 2003, and Higgins had
    been freelancing since then, hoping to get back into the National Basketball
    Association.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Enter the Oklahoma City Thunder, the newest team
    in the NBA. They needed a video guy, and they offered the gig to Higgins just
    days before their inaugural season began in October. He took it, and has worked
    almost nonstop since.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>It's a simple equation for Higgins. &quot;As far
    as being more attractive than Sacramento – yes, there is a job here for
    me!&quot; he said.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>Losing good people</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Many of those leaving California for the mid-South
    have valuable skills, census figures show. They skew younger and highly
    educated, the kind of people upon which a state builds its future.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>In concrete terms: California is losing people
    like Loren <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span class=SpellE><span style='color:black'>O'Laughlin</span></span><span
style='color:black'> is an artist and designer. He left Rancho Cordova when he
    got a scholarship from Oklahoma Christian University, and he liked the
    college's vibe. He never planned to stay in the area, but he met his wife in
    college, and he was wooed by a local company months before he graduated with a
    bachelor's degree in art and design.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Now <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span> designs
    trophies for MTM Recognition, a large outfit with big-name clients. When Dale
    Earnhardt Jr. raises that massive trophy over his head after winning a big
    NASCAR race, there's a pretty good chance that <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span> helped design it.</span></p>
  <p><span class=SpellE><span style='color:black'>O'Laughlin</span></span><span
style='color:black'> earns $16 an hour. It may not seem like a lot, but, along
    with his wife's job teaching English as a second language, the couple can
    afford a two-bedroom house in a cute neighborhood – think the area around the
    UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento – for which they pay $690 a month. (The
    median income is about 20 percent lower in Oklahoma City than in Sacramento,
    but that income goes 10 percent further, federal statistics show.)</span></p>
  <p><span class=SpellE><span style='color:black'>O'Laughlin</span></span><span
style='color:black'> admits to having mixed feelings about his adopted city.
    His wife, Penelope, grew up in Oklahoma, and she wants to leave as soon as she
    finishes her master's degree.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Devoutly Christian, <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin</span> is nonetheless frustrated by what he perceives as the religious ethos in many
    Oklahoma City suburbs. Or as he puts it in a typical rapid-fire tirade:
    &quot;The strange hybrid of
    Americana-consumer-driven-megachurch-evangelical-nothing-is-wrong-here-everything's-fine-oil-money-endowed-conservative
    Christianity that bombs recklessly around town in an H2.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>That frustration shows up in <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin's</span> art, much of it hanging these days at a local coffee shop where he is the
    artist of the month. His paintings are often bleak, modern interpretations of
    religious themes such as the stoning of St. Stephen. They're often painted on
    scraps of junk metal he finds while riding his bike to work.</span></p>
  <p><span class=SpellE><span style='color:black'>O'Laughlin</span></span><span
style='color:black'> is thinking about moving back to the West Coast, but to
    Portland, Ore., not Sacramento. Still, standing amid scrap he is rusting to
    artistic perfection in his backyard, he worries about leaving behind a good
    situation.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;The thought of moving somewhere else, as
    much as Penelope wants to be somewhere else,&quot; he said, &quot;<span
class=GramE>we</span> can't afford to have the lifestyle we have here.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style='color:black'>No intention of returning</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>As much as California could use more creative
    talent like <span class=SpellE>O'Laughlin's</span>, it needs newly minted
    nurses like Angela Outlaw even more. The state is short about 50,000 registered
    nurses, according to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>But Outlaw has no intention of returning to
    California. She has many quality hospitals to choose from in Oklahoma, and if
    she does move, she said, it will be to someplace like Austin, not like
    Antelope.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>&quot;I meet more Californians here than anyone
    else,&quot; said Outlaw, 42. &quot;And, most of them are planning on staying
    here permanently.&quot;</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Outlaw first left Sacramento for Texas but headed
    to Oklahoma a few years ago when her mother was transferred to Tinker Air Force
    Base after McClellan shut down. A California State University, Sacramento,
    graduate, Outlaw went back to school at the University of Oklahoma and will
    finish her nursing degree within a year.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>She spends many of her weekends hiking in the

  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We <a
href="http://okpolicy.org/blog/economy/oklahoma-is-not-a-poor-state-we-just-continue-to-play-one-on-tv/">recently
    reported</a> on how Oklahoma’s robust economic growth prior to the recent
    downturn vaulted the state from the poorest fifth of states early this decade,
    as measured by per capita personal income,&nbsp; to the 28th spot in 2008.
    Further confirmation of the state’s good fortunes is provided by the annual
    population estimates produced by the U.S. Census Bureau and aggregated into <a
href="http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/2008_Population_Estimates_by_State_2212082670.xls">user-friendly
    spreadsheets</a> by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. As can be seen from
    the table below, Oklahoma’s population growth trailed the national average for
    the first part of this decade, but then caught up and passed the national
    average in the three years of 2006-08. In 2008, the state’s population grew by
    an estimated 34,238 people, or 0.95 percent, slightly outpacing the 0.92
    percent population growth of the nation as a whole. The state’s estimated
    population on July 1, 2008 was 3,642,361, making it <span class=SpellE><span

    28th most populous state for the eighth straight year.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Since 2000, Oklahoma’s population has grown at an average
    annual rate of 0.67 percent, 27th fastest among the states but somewhat below
    the national average of 0.94 percent. During this period, Nevada has
    experienced the greatest population growth at an average annual rate of 3.24
    percent. Louisiana is the only state to have lost population since 2000, due to
    Hurricane <span class=SpellE>Katerina</span> and its aftermath, while Rhode
    Island, North Dakota, West Virginia and Michigan have all grown less than 0.1
    percent per year.</span></p>

href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/site/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleid=20090701_11_A1_Collin797999">New
    data</a> released last week showed population changes at the city level.
    Fairmont in Garfield County (+7.0 percent) and Collinsville in Tulsa County
    (+6.9 percent) were the state’s fastest growing cities in 2008. Oklahoma City’s
    population increased 1.2 percent in 2008 to 551,789 residents, while Tulsa grew
    0.5 percent to 385,635.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>At the state level, Oklahoma’s population growth this decade
    has been primarily due to <a
href="http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/2000_Oklahoma_Population_Estimates_by_Age_Race_Sex_Hispanic__1405092844.xls">growth
    in the state’s Hispanic population</a>.&nbsp; Hispanics account for a full 52
    percent of the state’s total population growth between 2000 and 2008. The
    Hispanic population grew by 55.4 percent in this period, while the number of
    non-Hispanics increased by just 2.8 percent. The growing Hispanic population
    reflects a combination of migration and a young population of child-bearing
    age.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Both<span class=GramE>&nbsp; international</span> and
    domestic migration have played a role in Oklahoma’s recent population growth.
    While the former has captured a great deal of attention, it is also the case
    that in recent years, more people are moving into Oklahoma from other states
    than are moving out. The June <a
href="http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/2009_June_Oklahoma_Data_Center_News_0906092879.pdf">Oklahoma
    Data Center newsletter</a> of the Department of Commerce examines data from the
    American Community Survey from 2005 to 2007 and finds that Oklahoma experienced
    a net population gain of 21,000 people moving from other states. Among the
    report’s findings:</span></p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li style='     line-height:normal;'><span
     style='     color:black'>In state-to-state comparisons, Oklahoma showed a net gain
      from all but 11 states.</span></li>
    <li style='     line-height:normal;'><span
     style='     color:black'>Oklahoma’s largest net population gain came from California,
      with some 6,000 more Californians heading to Oklahoma than those moving in
      the opposite direction. Oklahoma also enjoyed sizable net migration gains
      from <span class=GramE>new</span> Mexico, Florida, Arizona, and Ohio but
      lost residents to Alabama, Oregon, Kentucky and the Carolinas.</span></li>
    <li style='     line-height:normal;'><span
     style='     color:black'>Those moving to Oklahoma were largely young, with 50 percent
      between the ages <span class=SpellE>if</span> 18 and 39 and a median age
      of just 26.4. Less than 5 percent of transplants were over age 65.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>While Oklahoma’s recent population growth is good news in a
    number of ways, the state is not expected to regain its sixth Congressional
    seat lost after the 2000 Census. According to <a
href="http://www.electiondataservices.com/images/File/NR_Appor08wTables.pdf">projections </a>by Election Data Services, 8 or 9 states are likely to gain one or more
    seats in the 2010 Congressional reapportionment, while 10-12 states are likely
    to lose at least one seat;<span class=GramE>&nbsp; Oklahoma</span> is virtually
    guaranteed to hold steady with five seats in the House of Representatives.</span></p>

  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Tom <span class=SpellE>Joad</span> IV is a Perl engineer
    with a subprime mortgage and student loans to pay (Cover of The Grapes of

  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The <a
href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cal-jobs11-2010mar11,0,3667613.story?track=notottext"
target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a> published some really devastating
    unemployment numbers today – not only is unemployment rising in California
    generally, but in 8 of the Golden State’s counties, the rate is above 20%:</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>New county-by-county figures released by the state Wednesday
    showed that in eight counties, more than 1 in 5 people were out of work.
    Moreover, revised numbers for last year show that fewer people were employed
    than was previously believed.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The state was one of five, along with Florida, Georgia,
    North Carolina and South Carolina, that reached their highest unemployment
    rates since the government began keeping track in 1976, according to the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics. California’s was 12.5% in January, up from 12.3% in
    December.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[...]</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Most counties were still struggling under the burden of
    joblessness, especially the eight counties where rates were higher than 20%.
    Merced County, for instance, had an unemployment rate of 21.7% in January, and
    Imperial County’s rate was 27.3%.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>These numbers also got me thinking about the more <span
class=SpellE>triumphalist</span> reports we’ve heard about how some states are
    bucking the scary unemployment trends that places like California are facing.
    Oklahoma was on my mind in particular. I remember when <a
href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2006/08/10/im-moving-out-of-new-york-city/"
target="_blank">my cousin Penelope Trunk</a> was plotting her family’s flight
    from their tiny tenement in Brooklyn’s Park Slope a couple of years ago, and we
    joked around about moving to Oklahoma City because the cost of living was so
    low there.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Turns out it’s not such a joke!</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>In fact, a lot of people are making this choice. The <a
href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=12&amp;articleid=20091223_12_0_Oklaho220180"
target="_blank">Tulsa World</a> noted in December:</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The state added 43,025 residents from July 2008 to July
    2009, the largest annual increase this decade.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The annual increase also reverses the one-year dip when the
    population failed to increase more than it did the previous year.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Overall, the Census Bureau estimates the Oklahoma population
    was 3,687,050 in July 2009 compared to 3,644,025 in July 2008. The annual
    population increase was 39,780 in 2007 and 34,238 in 2008.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Most of the overall population increase was fueled by
    persons moving to Oklahoma from other states, defined as domestic migration.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Domestic migration accounted for 18,345 new residents to the
    state with international migrants accounting for 5,340 additional people.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It’s not quite gangbusters, but it shows that the state
    known more for the Dust Bowl than for economic opportunity has turned itself
    around in a lot of ways. The Oklahoman’s crack Database Editor Paul Monies <a
href="http://blog.newsok.com/datawatch/2009/07/01/visualizing-the-latest-city-population-estimates/"
target="_blank">put together some visualizations</a> of the differences in
    population between the Oklahoma of the Great Depression and the <span
class=SpellE>the</span> Oklahoma of the Great Recession. His <a
href="http://newsok.com/incoming-oklahoma-ranks-high-on-migration-list/article/3433215?custom_click=headlines_widget#ixzz0hth15LHY"
target="_blank">newspaper</a> went on some months later to reflect triumphantly
    in an editorial:</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Time was when Oklahomans fled to California in great
    numbers, so much so that the Golden State tried to put a stop to it. Now
    Californians are moving east; some of them are landing in Oklahoma. Cox says
    that <b>in every year during the 2000s, Oklahoma gained net domestic migrants
    from California</b>.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>So I guess it’s like The Grapes of Wrath in reverse. The <span
class=SpellE>Joads</span> have spent a few generations in California and may be
    wondering if they left a little too much behind on that dusty farmland where
    their <span class=SpellE>Okie</span> forebears squatted. And with more than 1
    in 4 people jobless in Imperial, the county that abuts San Diego County in
    southern California, the ones going east to destinations like Oklahoma City
    just might be making the right bet.</span></p>

  <p style='line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Boeing's announcement also highlights the importance of

  <h3>By Darrell A. Hughes</h3>
  <p>Facing high joblessness and lackluster economies, local governments are
    competing more aggressively with tax breaks and other incentives to lure
    companies to relocate to their regions.</p>
  <p>Economic development incentives put forth by Oklahoma, for example, helped
    them to convince <strong>Boeing</strong> Co. to move an aerospace maintenance
    division to Oklahoma City from Long Beach, Calif.</p>
  <p>Beginning next year, the aircraft manufacturing giant will begin shifting
    roughly 550 jobs to Oklahoma City. The relocation will begin in the spring of
    2011 and is scheduled to conclude by the end of 2012. “We hope a lot of
    companies take advantage of these incentive offers,” Oklahoma City Mayor <strong>Mick
    Cornett</strong> said.</p>
  <p>Oklahoma created an incentive package designed to attract what they call
    “21st century quality jobs.” Under their plan, Boeing is eligible to receive
    cash back, up to 10% of its payroll, for up to 10 years. According to <strong>Oklahoma’s
    Commerce Department</strong>, this incentive is a first; no other government
    across the U.S. is offering cash. Additionally, Boeing would also be eligible
    to apply for a 10% tax credit, per employee, for hiring an in-state engineering
    graduate. Those hired from out of state would make the firm eligible for a 5% tax
    credit.</p>
  <p>Aside from having attractive incentives for businesses, Oklahoma is slated
    to offer a $5,000 tax credit, for up to five years, to engineers hired into the
    aerospace industry.</p>
  <p>Boeing spokesman<strong> Forrest Gossett</strong> declined to discuss the
    role incentives played in the company’s decision to relocate. “I’m not in the
    position to determine whether [the incentives] were aggressive or not
    aggressive,” he said.</p>
  <p>U.S. Commerce Assistant Secretary for Economic Development <strong>John
    Fernandez</strong> said he understands why local governments are offering
    aggressive incentives in the current economic downturn. However, he said, the
    competition isn’t just among cities and states, “the competition is [among]
    regions all around the world.”</p>
  <p>Fernandez said state and local governments need to focus on creating
    globally competitive environments that build up the local work force, improve
    the roads and other infrastructure and provide support for entrepreneurs.</p>
  <p>“The goal isn’t to land just one company; the goal is to create an ecosystem
    where many companies can be born and grow to create jobs,” Fernandez said,
    adding that’s a “harder sell sometimes.”</p>
  <p>Oklahoma City Mayor Cornett and the state’s Commerce Secretary <strong>Natalie
    Shirley</strong> acknowledged the role of aggressive incentives, but said Oklahoma’s
    incentives were crafted with specific goals in mind. In the past, Oklahoma
    hadn’t provided inducements to attract targeted industries, such the
    engineering and information technology sectors.</p>
  <p>“The incentive packages were developed at the same time as the engineering
    tax credit, and were very strategic in the sense of driving towards a
    particular type of job that we wanted to see in the state,” Shirley said.</p>
  <p>Cornett said that ultimately, companies assess the cost of doing business
    and whether there is an adequate workforce. “Once people visit Oklahoma and see
    it, all questions are answered — but getting that first step in the door is a
    little bit tricky,” Cornett said.</p>
  <p>Even so, firms know there are limited projects, and many regions are
    searching for jobs, said <strong>Wayne Gregory</strong>, economic development
    director of Georgetown County in South Carolina. “You’ve got to be aggressive
    with the incentives in order to compete in the marketplace,” Gregory said,
    adding “you’ve got to pay to play.”</p>
