style='font-family:Arial'>But radio provided comedians long before those
horrible years. Many former vaudevillians were seeing great opportunities in
radio. One problem, however, was what to do with the lack of audience? Radio
required projecting a personality through a box and not via a live audience.
These former stage comedians based their humor and timing on the response of
their audience. Now they could not hear their audience and had to judge how
best to deliver their lines. Some succeeded, but others, despite stage and film
successes, failed miserably. Vaudevillians like Bert Lahr, Al Jolson and even
Jimmy Durante and Weber and Fields never really had successful radio careers,
yet enjoyed success in other media. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>But early radio comedy was very much like
vaudeville. One early success was Billy Jones and Ernie Hare. Their radio
careers were built around a sponsor and listeners knew them as <i>The Happiness
Boys</i>, then later as <i>The Interwoven Pair</i>. As their sponsorship
changed, so too did their name. Their comedy was based upon snappy songs and
patter as were the routines of Scrappy Lambert and Billy <span class=SpellE>Hillpot</span>
- known on radio as <i>Trade and Mark</i>, the Smith Brothers. Though there is
little if any recordings of these types of broadcasts, an example of a <a
href="http://www.otr.com/ra/weber_fields.mp3">Weber and Fields routine</a> from
a record gives an idea as to the banter that occurred between comedy teams of
the time.</span> <o:p></o:p></b></p>

</b><span class=GramE><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Gradually</span></b></span><b><span

earliest was created by two stage veterans who settled in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City></st1:place> and began a series of radio skits for
station WGN in 1926. Their radio personas were Sam Smith and Henry Johnson.
Their routine was based on Negro dialects, a popular form of comedic delivery
at the time, though both comedians were white. While the series never overtly
identified their characters as &quot;black,&quot; the <a
href="http://www.otr.com/comedy.shtml##">dialect</a> they used was familiar to
the audience having heard it from the blackface minstrel shows popular at the
time. </span></b><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_s1027" type="#_x0000_t75"

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Comedy continued to become more
sophisticated as radio moved into the thirties. It was at the beginning of this
decade that two of radio's greatest comedians made their broadcast debuts. Jack
Benny and Fred Allen would become friends, but radio would make a great public
relations move by <span class=SpellE>publically</span> creating an on-air feud
between them. At the same time, according to Michelle <span class=SpellE>Hilmes</span>
in her radio book, <i>Radio Voices</i>, Benny and Allen would form a middle
ground in radio comedy as their show <span class=SpellE>personnas</span> grew. <span
class=SpellE>Hilmes</span> says that early radio <span class=SpellE>personnas</span>
such as <span class=SpellE>Samual</span> L. <span class=SpellE>Rothafel</span>
from <span class=SpellE><i>Roxy</i></span><i> and His Gang</i> and Wendell Hall
from <i>The <span class=SpellE>Everyready</span> Hour</i> appeared as
&quot;themselves.&quot; Later narrative series such as <i>Fibber McGee &amp;
Molly, <span class=SpellE>Myrt</span> &amp; Marge, <span class=SpellE>Lum</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Abner</span></i> and <i>Amos n' Andy</i> contained
actors portraying characters unlike themselves. Jack Benny would forge a center
ground wherein a &quot;a complex and detailed 'life' was built up around Benny
and his cast involving not only his professional but his 'personal' life, with
cast members going over to his house, go shopping or on trips, taking the show
on the road, and getting into various scraps.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

bandleader, George Olsen.</span> <i>The Chase and Sanborn Hour</i> with Eddie
Cantor had proved with a 28.9 <span class=SpellE>Hooperrating</span> that what
listeners wanted was variety/comedy. Benny's first show was in this format. It
was not broadcast in front of an audience and sometimes sounded flat with Benny
delivering short gag lines between numbers and guests. Like other vaudeville
comedians, he was his best when he could hear the laughs. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Benny rose to popularity quickly moving
into the top ten in 1933 and to sixth place by 1934. His style was to give the
laughs to others and react to their humorous situations making <span
class=GramE>himself</span> look like the fool. The comedian soon included his
wife, Sadie Marks Benny, who was known on stage as (and later changed her name
to) Mary Livingstone. Gradually, like Fred Allen, he added other radio actors
who provided excellent characterizations of their own. Unlike Allen, Benny's
career into film and television continued very successfully. Allen's

Though there were individual comedians beginning to make their mark, the
thirties continued to provide successful comedy teams. One team that was
destined for radio, film and television stardom was <a
href="http://www.otr.com/ra/burns.ram"><i>Burns and Allen</i></a> <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

Burns met Gracie in 1922 and established a vaudeville act with Gracie as
&quot;straight man.&quot; Several years later, they realized that it was Gracie
who got the laughs, so the concept was reversed. Gracie continued to develop
the dizzy dame character while George took on the straight role, reacting to
Gracie's <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-adventures. Their early radio
appearances were on Eddie Cantor's and Rudy <span class=SpellE>Vallee's</span>
shows. In 1932 they signed on to CBS with their own show. George always said it
was Gracie who made the act. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

One could do literally anything through this medium. By leaving the imagination

Charlie McCarthy was a mere dummy of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. Yet despite
both voices being performed by <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Bergen</st1:City></st1:place>,
the concept clicked and the team became immensely popular. In the minds and

this technique for telling a story worked well in radio drama and especially in
the detective genre. It allowed the listener to relate immediately to the main
character and pulled the audience directly into the story. The success of much
of the detective fiction born out of the pulps is attributed to the type of
character created by pulp authors. The private detective tended to operate
outside of the law in order to bring criminals to justice. They lived and
worked among the seamier side of life, and there was definitely a class society
where the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. In much of the fiction we
constantly read the detectives own thoughts. Radio's use of the first-person
narrative allowed us to hear those <a

from the pages of the dime novels, or pulps, which were the entertainment for
many juveniles and others prior to radio. Early stories featuring Nick Carter
had such an edge. But it wasn't until the 1920's that the hardboiled detective
took on a more solid form. This genre sprung from the writings of <a

Howard Duff. Publishing in magazines such as <a
href="http://www.blackmaskmagazine.com/"><i>Black Mask</i></a>, Hammett's
written character was the classic hardboiled detective: ruthless, making no
moral claims, but not without scruples, yet without sentiment for criminals.
Sam Spade could not be bribed even though he appeared to be low enough to
accept a bribe. However, he was not opposed to the occasional bonus which might
not be totally on the up-and-up. Yet he was without pity for crime. In <i>The
Maltese Falcon</i>, where appearance and reality are not always the same, he
turns <span class=SpellE>Brigid</span> O'Shaughnessy, whom he could love, over
to the police because she was responsible for the death of Spade's detective
partner. Miss O'Shaughnessy was first introduced as Miss <span class=SpellE>Wonderly</span>.
Again goodness is not always what it seems - it can be deadly and a detective
needs to &quot;<span class=SpellE>hardboil</span>&quot; himself against
corruption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

   <st1:State w:st="on">Connecticut</st1:State></st1:place>, I interviewed
  Shirley Eggleston... I came across your reference to &quot;A Crime Letter
  from Dan Dodge&quot; in which you say that no copies of these shows exist.
  One does. At least the first ten minutes of one show exists. Ms. Eggleston
  brought her own copy to the studio and I played the first few minutes for our
  audience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p>Shirley Eggleston is best known for her recurring role in the 1950's version
  of the television soap opera <i>Valiant Lady</i> as Bonnie Withers. Her
  credited name for that series was Shirley <span class=SpellE>Egleston</span>
  (note: one &quot;g&quot;). She also appeared on the fifties television
  science fiction series <i>Tales of Tomorrow</i> and on radio also in <i>I Was
  A Convict, Whispering Streets, The Road of Life</i> and <em>Dorothy Dix</em>
  among other shows..<span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p>The first ten minutes unfortunately was not played on the show. What was
  played was a 3.5 minute segment. The copy that Shirley had with her was
  loaned out never to be seen again. So all that is currently available to the
  OTR community is the 3.5 minute segment.</p>
  <p><strong><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:red'>UPDATE:</span> Since
  this was written, two shows have surfaced. Jack French and I were able to
  track down the missing <span class=SpellE>ETs</span> and I was able to secure
  them and transcribe them. They are <span class=SpellE>are</span> not true <span
  class=SpellE>ETs</span> but rather copies of the show with commercials
  roughly cut out as well as portions that some of the characters were not in
  (unfortunately) and re-written to LP. The quality is not great, but now we
  can enjoy two partial episodes of this previously unavailable program.</strong></p>
  <p>The two episodes available for download are the only copies known to
  exist. You can download them here in mp3 format slightly cleaned up. These
  versions are 9 &amp; 7 megs in size and will take quite a while without
  high-speed access.</p>
