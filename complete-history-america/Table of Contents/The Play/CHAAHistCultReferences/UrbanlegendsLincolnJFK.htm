  Not long after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the above
  list of amazing coincidences appeared, and it has been widely and
  continuously reprinted and circulated ever since. Despite the seemingly
  impressive surface appearance, several of these entries are either misleading
  or factually incorrect, and the rest are mere superficial coincidences that
  fail to touch upon the substantial differences and dissimilarities that
  underlie them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
  style='color:#000088'>This statement is literally true: both Lincoln and
  Kennedy were first elected to Congress one hundred years apart. Aside from
  that minor coincidence, however, their political careers bore little
  resemblance to each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-right:.5in;
  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
  style='color:#000088'>Lincoln was an Illinois state legislator who, outside
  of his election to a single term in the House of Representatives, failed in
  his every attempt to gain national political office until he was elected
  President in 1860, including an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1854, a unsuccessful
  bid to become the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1856, and another
  unsuccessful bid for a Senate seat in 1858. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
  style='color:#000088'>Kennedy, on the other hand, enjoyed an unbroken string
  of political successes at the national level when he entered the political
  arena after World War II. He was elected to the House of Representatives in
  1946, re-elected in 1948, re-elected again in 1950, won a Senate seat in
  1952, was re-elected to the Senate in 1958, and was elected President in
  1960. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  style='color:#000088'>It's hardly surprising that two men who (as noted
  above) both achieved their first political successes at the national level a
  hundred years apart would also ascend to the Presidency a hundred years
  apart. This &quot;coincidence&quot; is even less surprising when we consider
  that presidential elections are held only once every four years. <st1:City
  w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City> couldn't
  possibly have been elected President in 1857 or 1858 or 1859 or 1861 or 1862
  or 1863, because no presidential elections were held in those years.
  Likewise, Kennedy couldn't possibly have been elected President in the
  non-election years of 1957, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, or 1963. So, even though
  both men were politically active at the national level during eight-year
  spans when they <i>might</i> have been elected President, circumstances
  dictated that the only years during those spans when they both <i>could</i>
  have been elected were exactly one hundred years apart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  President, but Kennedy was killed before the completion of his first term. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
  style='color:#000088'>Surely this is the most trivial of coincidences,
  especially considering that the two men's first names contain different
  numbers of letters, and that Kennedy had a middle name (Fitzgerald) while <st1:City
  w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City> had none. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-right:.5in;
  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
  style='color:#000088'>We're supposed to be amazed at minor happenstances such
  as the two <span class=GramE>men's being</span> elected exactly one hundred
  years apart or having the same number of letters in their last names, but
  we're supposed to think nothing of the numerous non-coincidences: <st1:place
  w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:City></st1:place> was born in
  1809; Kennedy was born in 1917. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>
  died in 1865; Kennedy died in 1963. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>
  was 56 years old at the time of his death; Kennedy was 46 years old at the
  time of his death. No striking coincidences or convenient hundred-year
  differences in any of those facts. Even when we consider that, absent all
  other factors, the two men had a one in twelve chance of dying in the same
  month, we find no coincidence there: <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>
  was killed in April; Kennedy was killed in November. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt were both &quot;particularly concerned

  &quot;particularly concerned with economics.&quot; Neither Lincoln nor
  Kennedy evinced a &quot;particular interest&quot; in civil rights, and to all
  appearances, both would willingly have maintained the racial status quo had
  events beyond their control not forced their hands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-right:.5in;

  style='color:#000088'>Although <st1:City w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:City> was

  divisiveness affected the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
    States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, not the liberation of the Black
  man. Had the Union been able to survive half slave and half free without
  erupting into war, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>'s
  stated position was that he would have allowed the institution of slavery to
  remain intact and die a slow death. And whatever Lincoln's personal feelings
  about the equality of Blacks, he didn't espouse support for their &quot;civil
  rights&quot; because he believed that white society would never accept them
  as equals. <st1:City w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:City>'s only real expression of
  &quot;civil rights&quot; was his support for the idea of relocating free Blacks
  to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Liberia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
  so they could live apart from whites in a separate society. Even <st1:City
  w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:City>'s Emancipation Proclamation was issued as an
  exigency of war, not as measure intended to permanently end slavery in the <st1:country-region
  w:st="on">USA</st1:country-region>, and constitutional amendments ending slavery
  and guaranteeing citizens of all races the right to vote were not enacted
  until after <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>'s
  death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-right:.5in;

  style='color:#000088'>In Kennedy's case, it was only after racial crises such

  (James Meredith) to attend class and the bombing of the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address

  that he belatedly moved to promote civil rights legislation. Even then, his
  lack of support in Congress (and, ultimately, his assassination) meant that
  the task of passing civil rights legislation (such as the Civil Rights Act of
  1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965) fell to his successor, Lyndon
  Johnson. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  we're wrong and the odds are really one in forty-nine. If you think we're
  wrong, you don't understand the question.) Add to that the obvious notions
  that the best chance the average person has to shoot a President is at a
  public function and that most public functions are held on weekends, and it
  becomes even more likely that a President would be killed on a Friday,
  Saturday, or Sunday. (Indeed, an earlier plot by Booth to kidnap <st1:City

  least bit coincidental, especially considering that since both Lincoln and
  Kennedy were shot from behind and while seated, their assassins had no other
  practical choice of target. And the &quot;coincidence&quot; here is even less
  surprising when we consider the differences: <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
