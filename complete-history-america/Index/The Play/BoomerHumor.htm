<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Feb. 19, 2007 issue - The gap-toothed, jug-eared
idiot gazes out from the cover of the magazine, lost in a state of moronic
bliss. The face is familiar, for sure—with that stupid smile, like Ron Howard's
<span class=SpellE>Opie</span> with a lobotomy—but it is not quite Alfred E. <span
class=SpellE>Neuman</span>, the iconic simpleton of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Mad.</st1:place></st1:country-region> This is the August 1971 issue
of the National Lampoon, and for the occasion illustrator Kelly <span
class=SpellE>Freas</span> has created a portrait that, as much as any single
work can, captures the essence of boomer humor. The idiot, with his ludicrous
apple-cheeks and shock of red hair falling across his forehead, is wearing the
uniform of the United States Army, with crossed rifles and matching gold <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> insignia
on the collar of his green jacket and a blue combat infantryman's badge over
the left pocket. The name tag over his right pocket reads CALLEY. <span
class=SpellE>Neuman's</span> imbecilic motto—&quot;What, me worry?&quot;—has
been rewritten and emblazoned across &quot;<span class=SpellE>Calley's</span>&quot;
chest in black type: WHAT, <st1:place w:st="on">MY LAI</st1:place>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'><a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17083395/site/newsweek/#storyContinued#storyContinued"></a></span><a
name=storyContinued></a>It is as good as a joke can get, and more than 35 years
later I can still recall the deep awe I felt the first time I saw it. First of
all, it's shocking, a masterpiece of bad taste that links the mass murder of
innocents during wartime with the blank visage of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s best-known dolt. (Lt.
William <span class=SpellE>Calley</span> was convicted of murder in 1971 for
his role in the 1968 <st1:place w:st="on">My Lai</st1:place> massacre, in which
hundreds of Vietnamese women, children and seniors were shot to death by
American soldiers. Photographs from that period confirm the vague resemblance
to <span class=SpellE>Neuman</span> that <span class=SpellE>Freas</span> zeroed
in on and immortalized.) Dark and ruthless, the <span class=SpellE>Calley-as-Neuman</span>
cover (or is it <span class=SpellE>Neuman-as-Calley</span>?) makes it clear
that absolutely nothing was sacred to the Lampoon editors. The cover is timely
and news-driven, as the best humor often is, and it addresses one of the most
important issues that boomers ever faced—the Vietnam War. At the same time, it acknowledges
the past with a tip of the hat to Mad, the bible of irreverence where many
boomers first learned that it was OK to make fun of ... everything. Finally, it
includes a great pun. It is, in other words, a classic.</p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thanks to shared experience and a unique set of
comic influences, we baby boomers can count as part of our legacy a distinct
brand of humor that at its best (National Lampoon, &quot;Saturday Night
Live,&quot; &quot;Animal House,&quot; &quot;Eddie Murphy Raw,&quot;
&quot;Seinfeld,&quot; &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;) actually fulfills the
promise of our much-touted, often disappointing generation. Iconoclastic, in
thrall to the absurd, self-absorbed, self-effacing, angry, truth-seeking—boomer
humor may not always have a point (David Letterman's Velcro suit comes to mind)
but it is usually funny, often smart and almost always well crafted. It also
links the radio days of pre-World War II America with the age of the Internet,
where I recently enjoyed Dan <span class=SpellE>Aykroyd's</span> classic sketch
from the first season of &quot;SNL,&quot; the &quot;Super Bass <span
class=SpellE>O'Matic</span> '76.&quot; <span class=GramE>(Turns out that
chopping up stuff in blenders is quite popular these days on <span
class=SpellE>YouTube</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Looking back, the most striking thing about our
formative years is the paltry number of media options available to us. In the <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State> metropolitan
area, the white-hot center of the broadcasting industry in the 1950s and '60s,
we had exactly seven TV channels to choose from, including the three major
networks—CBS, NBC and ABC. As a result, we all ended up watching the same
stuff. Despite the dearth of choices in those pre-cable years—because of the
dearth, in fact—&quot;mass media was its most mass,&quot; notes best-selling
author and former Lampoon editor P. J. O'Rourke. &quot;It hadn't broken up into
all of its <span class=SpellE>microniches</span>. We're probably the one
generation on earth with the most points of reference in common.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The roots of boomer humor are sunk deep in the
1930s, when scores of short subjects featuring the Little Rascals and the Three
Stooges were originally produced. These black-and-white classics were
repackaged for television in the 1950s, and impressionable young boomers like <span
class=GramE>myself</span> were soon immersed daily in the chaos and
anti-establishment antics of Moe, Larry, Curly, <span class=SpellE>Spanky</span>,
Alfalfa, Buckwheat and the rest of their motley cohort. Rich in Depression-era
details—horse-drawn ice wagons, pug-faced truant officers, electric fans with
open blades, flypaper—the films introduced us to a world where responsible
adults were in short supply and authority figures existed for the sole purpose
of being defied and undermined. The race-blind Rascals, black and white, stuck
together to overcome bullies and pompous rich kids alike. Ingenious (ducks
helped power their boat) and resilient, they never gave up and never gave in.
The Stooges, best known for bashing each other, spent an equal amount of time
making fools of cops, lawyers, doctors, businessmen and any other stuffed
shirts or mustached blowhards who crossed their path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We also enjoyed a steady diet of cartoons from
the same period, featuring such masters of mayhem as Popeye and his <span
class=SpellE>archnemesis</span> <span class=SpellE>Bluto</span>, whose
tornado-like fistfights punctuated each episode. As if to offset the relentless
diet of violence they were feeding us, the Popeye cartoons constantly promoted
the nutritional benefits of spinach, especially when eaten directly from the can,
which could be blowtorched open with a superheated corncob pipe if, for
example, you happened to be wrapped in an anchor chain and pinned to the ocean
floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But boomer humor may owe its greatest debt to <span
class=GramE>Mad</span> magazine, which, befitting such a boomer touchstone, was
created in 1952. &quot;Like a lot of us, I grew up with a hard-nosed dad,&quot;
says veteran comedy writer Danny Jacobson, who, among other credits, was <span
class=SpellE>cocreator</span> of the 1990s boomer sitcom &quot;Mad <span
class=GramE>About</span> You.&quot; <span class=GramE>&quot;Depression era,
World War II, all of that.</span> And when I looked at <span class=GramE>Mad</span>
magazine, I knew it was OK to think like this, to laugh at s--t like
this.&quot; Mad liberated a generation by ripping every institution,
organization and idea that our parents, teachers, priests and rabbis held out
to us as deserving of our respect and obedience. School, any and every form of
government, the military, organized religion, life in suburbia, the rich, the
middle class, the poor, all of it was fodder for satire and parody. Gloriously
sophomoric at times, stunningly cynical at others, Mad also attacked our
favorite athletes (Mickey Mantle), movie stars (Humphrey Bogart), TV shows
(&quot;Bonanza&quot;) and comic-book characters (Charlie Brown).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It made fun of the cold war and what seemed at
the time to be the very real possibility of nuclear annihilation; when you are
9 and air-raid drills are part of your third-grade routine, it's not so easy to
laugh at a joke in which the punch line is a mushroom cloud. But what else
could we do? &quot;I've got some Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe award,&quot;
says Jacobson, &quot;and all that stuff's great. But the most flattering thing
to me was that two of the shows I had a big hand in—'Roseanne' and 'Mad <span
class=GramE>About</span> You'—were parodied in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Mad.</st1:country-region></st1:place> Those are my Emmys.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the early 1960s, young boomers also grooved
to what were called &quot;party records.&quot; These LPs, which our parents
actually played during cocktail parties, included stand-up routines by <span
class=SpellE>Redd</span> Foxx, Bob Newhart and others, weird stuff like a
&quot;farting contest&quot; record I used to listen to at a friend's house
(&quot;He worked his way to America on a cabbage boat,&quot; went one
unforgettable line), Allan Sherman's &quot;My Son, the Nut,&quot; with the
briefly inescapable &quot;Hello <span class=SpellE>Muddah</span>, Hello <span
class=SpellE>Fadduh</span>,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The First Family,&quot;
starring JFK impressionist Vaughn <span class=SpellE>Meader</span>. At the same
time, we were watching people like <span class=SpellE>Shecky</span> Greene and
Alan King riff about drunks and stewardesses on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (a
rare Friday-night treat) and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; And comic Lewis
Black remembers the surreal style of Jonathan Winters. &quot;He was really the
wild card in the bunch,&quot; says Black. &quot;I'm not saying he was insane,
but what he did was find the comedy in insanity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It was all very cool, in a skinny-tie,
sharkskin-suit sort of a way. Then the Beatles arrived, &quot;the sixties&quot;
really started and the final pieces of the boomer humor puzzle fell into place.
The Sullivan-style variety show morphed into &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour&quot; and &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In.&quot; The <span
class=SpellE>Firesign</span> Theatre comedy group (and, later, <span
class=SpellE>Cheech</span> &amp; <span class=SpellE>Chong</span>) reinvented
the party album for pot-smoking college students. Richard Pryor and George
Carlin, the godfathers of boomer humor, abandoned the Vegas-style approach to
stand-up, with its emphasis on bits and gags, and started talking about life in
America's ghettos, Vietnam, drugs, politics and other loaded subjects. Thus
marinated, the boomers were finally ready to make <span class=GramE>themselves</span>
laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The counterculture was a few seasons past ripe
when the first issue of the National Lampoon was published in April 1970. The
Manson Family murders (August 1969) had already happened and the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kent</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
shootings (May 1970) were just around the bend. <st1:City w:st="on">Woodstock</st1:City>'s
peace and music (August 1969) had been quickly followed by the discord and
murder of <st1:place w:st="on">Altamont</st1:place> (December 1969). <span
class=SpellE>Jimi</span> Hendrix and Janis Joplin would both be dead before the
November issue hit newsstands. What more could a bunch of brilliant humorists
ask for?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Founding editors Doug Kenney and Henry Beard
(who met at the Harvard Lampoon, which has since become a kind of training
ground for TV writers) and their colleagues worked with familiar tools—comic
books, album covers, yearbooks, Sunday supplements—all the usual flotsam and
jetsam of American culture. But this was something different and new. The debt
to <span class=GramE>Mad</span> was clear, but the Lampoon—written by boomers
for boomers—was hipper, smarter and nastier than its ancestor. It obliterated
obvious targets like Spiro Agnew and Playboy (rendered as &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Playdead</span>,&quot; with a <span class=SpellE>flatlined</span>
centerfold in a hospital bed), but also took down hippies and the peace movement.
And lest anyone attempt to detect a master plan, Anne <span class=SpellE>Beatts</span>,
who joined the Lampoon in 1970 (and was also an original member of the
&quot;SNL&quot; writing staff), offers this: &quot;The Lampoon was a job for
people who couldn't get any other jobs and couldn't get up early. It was people
who were basically unemployable rejects of the system who fell into comedy like
it was a bathtub.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the early 1970s, while the Lampoon was at its
coruscating best, Pryor and Carlin continued to give concerts and release
landmark albums. Their groundbreaking work in this period helped spark a new
era in stand-up. Among the boomers who followed them to the stage: Jay Leno,
David Letterman, Roseanne, Robin Williams, <span class=SpellE>Whoopi</span>
Goldberg, Garry <span class=SpellE>Shandling</span>, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry
David, Eddie Murphy, Ellen <span class=SpellE>DeGeneres</span>, Bill Maher and
Al Franken. One way to appreciate the reach of boomer humor is to make a list
of all the TV comedies, talk shows, concert DVDs, books and movies generated by
that crowd of &quot;comics&quot; over the past 30 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though it's no longer a boomer show, and hasn't
been one for years, &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; which debuted with Carlin
as host in October 1975, remains the ultimate expression of boomer humor. A lot
of what John <span class=SpellE>Belushi</span>, Gilda <span class=SpellE>Radner</span>,
Bill Murray, <span class=SpellE>Aykroyd</span>, Murphy and the rest of the
&quot;SNL&quot; team produced in the first decade of the show was really funny,
and some of it was more than that. <span class=SpellE>Radner's</span> energy
and extraordinary range erased all doubts about whether women could be funny.
Murphy as Buckwheat, singing his incomprehensible &quot;greatest hits,&quot;
with helpful subtitles, a perfect confluence of boomer comedian and boomer
source material, was timeless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=textbodyblack><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
