<p>Once again, CATCO is
    very grateful to the <strong>Department of
    History and the College of Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State
    University</strong> for the opportunity to share with

    Central
    Ohio--and via the web, the world--insights into the process of
    "putting on a show." The last
    time this was done was in the spring 2001, when CATCO produced Frank

Galati's "<em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>" Visit the</em> <a href="/grapes-of-wrath">Grapes of Wrath</a> pages.</p>
  <p>For every
    production, CATCO hires a dramaturg to collect
    information about the play (its structure and setting), the playwright, and
    past productions.  This information,
    which is often put together into an "Actors' Book," aids the director in establishing
    an approach and it helps the actors prepare for their different
    characterizations.  It is supplemental
    information that furnishes facts and context, for the director, actors,
    properties master, music director, and costume, scenic, lighting, and sound designers, <strong>always</strong> do their own research as well.  The key
    word is "collaboration"; everyone collaborates and shares information with
    everyone else.  In the case of "<em>You're My Boy</em>", an original production, the playwright Herb
  </p>
<p>The dramaturg prepares not only the Actors' Book, but also Play
    Notes, which is a shorter published version of the Actors' Book.  This publication is made available to high
    school students and, sometimes, the subscribers.
